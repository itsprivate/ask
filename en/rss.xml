&lt;p&gt;She grew up in the Connecticut suburbs. Her family&amp;#39;s money is old. It comes from the heyday of NYC advertising. She and her siblings attended separate private boarding schools growing up, and they pay for everything with their own cards attached to their parent&amp;#39;s accounts. Their private college is paid for in full as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I myself am from a working class background. I grew up in rural Pennsylvania and I am the first and only person so far in my family to attend college. I grew up living in trailer courts and eventually, a modest 3 bd 1 bath house. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My gf and I have been together for about 4 months, and she has been consistently tight-lipped (as most wealthy people are) regarding her family&amp;#39;s lifestyle and exactly how much money they have. But I&amp;#39;m very observant and it doesn&amp;#39;t take a rocket scientist to figure out when someone is heavily privileged compared to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend, I had the pleasure of traveling with my gf to Connecticut to meet her parents for the first time. Let me just say: Holy shit. I was right. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her family is clearly wealthy. I mean, they don&amp;#39;t own private jets or anything, but the house is a massive 6 bedroom, 6 bathroom place located on a huge piece of property with an incredibly nice courtyard, pool area, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the weeks leading up to this visit, I was a nervous wreck about how a poor kid like me might come off to them. They aren&amp;#39;t snobby people or anything, but I was really nervouse because of the class difference, and I vaguely told my gf this a few times before we went up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we got there, I must&amp;#39;ve looked like a deer in the headlights. The place was easily the most gorgeous home I&amp;#39;ve ever been in. I was blown away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after we arrived and we had a minute to ourselves, my gf came up to me, gave me a kiss and a hug and said, sincere as could be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;See? I told you were worried for nothing. My family isn&amp;#39;t even rich, as you can clearly see.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my question is....how and why are rich people so out of touch about how rich they really are???&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#39;s been called the revenge of the nerds. How does philosophy respond?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My gut instinct is a sort of unease. I&amp;#39;m conflicted. Some anxiety, as well. Reflect, on the one hand - the hundreds of millions of working poor suffering from the aftermath of two waves of a global pandemic, fresh new global recession incoming - and on the other hand, a small selection of digital creators who can now sell digital pictures of flowers for $25,000. I&amp;#39;ve read many jubilant claims that this is a revolutionising moment ... but I don&amp;#39;t know what is being revolutionised. Is it not an otherwise revolutionary means of ignoring the ecological impact of crypto? What is it solving? What issues? Or is it an innovative means of ignoring them?   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose a lot of Very Online people feel that this is a turning point in making concrete that which was was abstract in questions of the value of digital labour, especially art, but I don&amp;#39;t know how much of a huge win this is considering how much of modern capitalism is already produced through digital labour. Does this signify anything that might change the ways in which digital labour has been systematically de-valued historically? Is there radical potential for something which is so cripplingly capitalistic? It seems to me, a more complicated yet democratised means of speculation.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is - your opinion on NFTs, and whether you have any philosophical literature which tackles the NFT craze you would like to share? I&amp;#39;m interested in all aspects of the debate, but especially anti-capitalist and post-structural opinions, if there are any yet.   &lt;/p&gt;

We are here to answer any questions any of you have to do with science or technology and how they affect your life. There are no silly questions - ask us anything and we will try to give an easy-to-understand answer and, wherever possible, provide some further sources to enable you to do your own research/reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal is simply to advance everyone&amp;#39;s understanding of science, engineering and technology and to help people be better informed about the issues likely to affect them and their families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More info / Longer read:&lt;/strong&gt; CSES is a registered charity in the UK, founded in 1920. We&amp;#39;re a volunteer group of over 250 members and our key strength is our diversity and interdisciplinary expertise. Our members come from a variety of educational, social and economic backgrounds, from industry and academia and a multitude of age groups, representing groups from the millennials all the way to the Silent Generation (our oldest member being 97)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been growing dis-information globally in the last 20 years. Today&amp;#39;s global interconnectedness, while being hugely beneficial for making information easily accessible to everyone, has made it ever more difficult to determine &amp;#39;truth&amp;#39; and who to trust. As an independent charity, not affiliated or biased to any particular group, but with broad knowledge we are here to answer any questions you may have and to hopefully point you to further reading!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal is simply to answer as many of your questions as we can - but we aren&amp;#39;t able to give advice on things - sorry! We will also be clear where what we are saying is the experience-based opinion of someone in our team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSES will draw from its large pool of volunteers to answer your questions, however the people standing by to answer comments are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vic Leverett OBE: 40 years&amp;#39; engineering experience with previous director-level positions Europe&amp;#39;s largest defence/engineering companies. Honoured by The Queen with an OBE for services to engineering and defence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professor David Humber: 30 years&amp;#39; experience as a researcher, lecturer and senior university manager specialising in immuno-biology and the life sciences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;David Whyte: Technologist and Chartered Engineer with 10 years&amp;#39; Research and Deployment experience and 15 international patents across a wide range of technologies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amy Knight: Science teacher and artist experienced in art/science collaborations with organisations like Soapbox Science and The Royal Society; her work has been featured at the Tate Modern&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Tate Exchange&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anthony McQuiggan: 10 years of engineering experience and 30 years as a serial entrepreneur having built a number of very successful start-up SME technology companies in the UK, Japan and the USA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roger Pittock: 36 years&amp;#39; experience in electronics, software, mechanical, electrical, process engineering, and safety systems. Avid supporter of the Consumers&amp;#39; Association, currently serving on their Council.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adam Wood - President of CSES: Chartered Engineer with over 12 years&amp;#39; experience in electronics, software and systems engineering, working in the medical / healthcare, transport and aerospace industries.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small post, just wanted to let you know we&amp;#39;ve decided to temporarily pause trans-related questions due to the vitriolic nature of the replies from all sides of this issue and how repetitive it&amp;#39;s gotten. We are hopeful this won&amp;#39;t catch too many other types of questions but understand that sexuality questions can sometimes get caught in our filter so don&amp;#39;t hesitate to message us if you believe your question has nothing to do with trans/NB/pronoun stuff and we will review it for approval. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re here to ask a trans question, you really should try using our search bar. The recent influx of trans questions to the sub means that not only has your question likely already been answered but it also means you&amp;#39;ll get to skip out on all the additional harassment from users who either refuse to give you the benefit of the doubt or are here to act in bad faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this? I can understand commitments to left wing views on politicized topics such as climate science or evolution, or other social issues. But why is capitalism so widely despised, particularly among ethicists, who otherwise seem capable of enough radical skepticism to seriously entertain the thought that anything could be moral or immoral? How can we KNOW with enough certainty that a political idea is worth spending effort on?&lt;/p&gt;
