I love being asleep and always have super vivid dreams. I can’t explain the feeling. It’s what I imagine being high feels like since I’ve never been high. I’m addicted. </p>\n\n<p>My alarm went off today at 10:30 because I wanted to wake up at a decent hour but I don’t have to be anywhere until 2 today so I turned off my alarm and slept till 12. Ugh I wish I could’ve slept more it felt so good but I need to start getting ready. </p>\n\n<p>When I don’t have work I sleep all day. I just love how it feels. It makes me feel so warm and happy and wonderful. It’s like a drug. </p>\n\n<p>I’m 27 and have been like this since high school. </p>\n\n<p>I’d rather just sleep all day and enjoy myself than do anything productive. This can’t be healthy and I don’t know how to break it. </p>\n\n<p>It doesn’t help that whenever I wake up I’m usually tired. No matter how many hours I get. 5, 8, 10, 12. All tired. So I always opt for more sleep unless I have to go somewhere. Some days I even call out of work because of how painfully tired I am just to sleep. </p>\n\n<p>I try to wake up earlier and I just always hit snooze. </p>\n\n<p>I know this is bad for me but at the same time I don’t want to give it up. It feels so good.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/l43iyu/can_someone_be_addicted_to_sleep_serious/","title":"Can someone be addicted to sleep?
