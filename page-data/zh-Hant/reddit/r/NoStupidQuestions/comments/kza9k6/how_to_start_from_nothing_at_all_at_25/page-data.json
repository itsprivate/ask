I have spent an almost inifinite amount of hours in my bed struggling with pain, systemic infections, and depression. My only escape was listening music thinking &quot;this too shall pass&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m finally about cured now at 25 (haven&#39;t had issues in 4 months for the first time) but I can&#39;t get disability help here because I&#39;m cured.</p>\n\n<p>I never never had any job, I don&#39;t have skills nor experience, nor friends, nor driver&#39;s license. I have completed one year of college in engineering (chemical) with satisfying results before I got ill. I had good grades in high school. I failed 3 times my 2nd year of engineering school because I was too fucking sick (and I really was, was in hospital for 6 months on the first year) so in my country they won&#39;t allow me to apply again even though I have proofs I was seriously sick.</p>\n\n<p>I have a bit of inheritance money (20k$) on which I&#39;m living at the moment. I can&#39;t get governmental help anymore because of being too old.</p>\n\n<p>I wished to become an engineer but it feels like it&#39;s too late and when I am at the schools won&#39;t take me anymore because of age limit at 25 so maybe I could consider moving abroad if I spoke the language. Ageism is known to be strong here and I can&#39;t find success story of anyone entering a job at more than 30 which would be the age I could complete a degree by.</p>\n\n<p>I have applied to some entry level jobs (50+ resume sent) but I&#39;m getting discarded every time. Never got an interview. Basically here the government will fund entry level jobs for people under 25 so you needed to start before that.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;d like to do something interesting with my life and not be stuck with entry level jobs forever.</p>\n\n<p>I can learn a language if needed. I speak Spanish and English.</p>\n\n<p>Where do I start ? Do you know any country that would be welcoming and without massive ageism ? Any job or sector which would be welcoming?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Note : I hate anything IT, I tried to get into it some months ago as I was getting better, but I really hate that.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/kza9k6/how_to_start_from_nothing_at_all_at_25/","title":"How to start from nothing at all at 25?","tags":["NoStupidQuestions","reddit"],"date":"January 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-17T19:34:14.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-17 19:34","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kza9k6","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/kza9k6/how_to_start_from_nothing_at_all_at_25/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/kza9k6/how_to_start_from_nothing_at_all_at_25/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"NoStupidQuestions","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions","author":"VogMicro","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/VogMicro","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"VogMicro","score":130,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"25岁如何白手起家？","the_new_excerpt":"你好啊\n\n长话短说，25岁的男性，我得了一种自身免疫性疾病，基本上是\n完全搞砸了6年的生活，我已经失去了。我已经花了几乎\n在我的床上挣扎了无限的时间 疼痛，全身感染，\n和抑郁症。我唯一的逃避就是听着音乐想着... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"25歲如何白手起家？","the_new_excerpt":"你好啊\n\n長話短說，25歲的男性，我得了一種自身免疫性疾病，基本上是\n完全搞砸了6年的生活，我已經失去了。我已經花了幾乎\n在我的牀上掙扎了無限的時間 疼痛，全身感染，\n和抑鬱症。我唯一的逃避就是聽着音樂想着... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lj9jim","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/AskReddit/comments/lj9jim/whats_a_cold_harsh_fact_youve_come_to_realize/","title":"Whats a cold harsh fact you've come to realize?","date":"February 14, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"什么是一个冷酷的事实，你已经意识到？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"什麼是一個冷酷的事實，你已經意識到？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lj6ruy","excerpt":"One of the cats in my house is so static-y that whenever I pet him, he gets\nzapped by my fingers.
