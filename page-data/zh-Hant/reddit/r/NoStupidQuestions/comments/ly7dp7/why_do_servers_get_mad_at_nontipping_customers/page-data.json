And I want to say that I am genuinely curious about this AND I always tip at least 20%. However, I don&#39;t really understand why some servers get very upset at non-tipping customers rather than at their employers. I understand that it is a hard job, and that some workers don&#39;t get paid very much so the tips help make up for that, but I feel like the responsibility should not be on the customer to pay additional money for the server&#39;s wage. My friend worked as a server and would get paid $2.70 an hour and rely on tips for her wage. I see countless rants from servers on Social Media about non-tipping customers and I am just confused. Why isn&#39;t that energy redirected at the employer paying them $2.70 an hour? Why haven&#39;t more people and servers tried to pass laws to ensure that servers are paid a better wage, and do not have to rely on tips? I have wondered this for years.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/ly7dp7/why_do_servers_get_mad_at_nontipping_customers/","title":"Why do servers get mad at non-tipping customers rather than their employers who are not paying them a fair wage?","tags":["NoStupidQuestions","reddit"],"date":"March 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-05T12:32:39.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-05 12:32","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ly7dp7","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/ly7dp7/why_do_servers_get_mad_at_nontipping_customers/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/ly7dp7/why_do_servers_get_mad_at_nontipping_customers/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"NoStupidQuestions","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions","author":"Worth-Ad8369","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Worth-Ad8369","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Worth-Ad8369","score":356,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"为什么服务员会对不给小费的顾客发火，而不是对没有给他们合理工资的雇主发火？","the_new_excerpt":"好吧，这个问题其实是针对我们所有生活在美国的人来说的，而且是较\n适用于非COVID时代。我想说的是，我真的很好奇\n关于这一点，我总是至少给20%的小费。然而，我真的不明白为什么\n有些服务员对不给小费的顾客非常不满，而不是... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼服務員會對不給小費的顧客發火，而不是對沒有給他們合理工資的僱主發火？","the_new_excerpt":"好吧，這個問題其實是針對我們所有生活在美國的人來說的，而且是較\n適用於非COVID時代。我想說的是，我真的很好奇\n關於這一點，我總是至少給20%的小費。然而，我真的不明白爲什麼\n有些服務員對不給小費的顧客非常不滿，而不是... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ly35bo","excerpt":"Hi, this is my first Reddit post.
