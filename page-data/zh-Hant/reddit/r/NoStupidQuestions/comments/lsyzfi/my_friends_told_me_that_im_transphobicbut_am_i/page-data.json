I never was convinced about social sciences and gender studies in general, but I really didn&#39;t care at all: those were two human beings who I considered as friends, so just using the pronoun &quot;she&quot; instead of &quot;he&quot;, EVEN if I was not convinced of anything, really was no big deal, and I never once felt uncomfortable using the said pronouns...</p>\n\n<p>...however, very recently, I ended up asking questions, via a skype group (in which we&#39;re very active) about the very concept of transgender and transexuality, as well as (no surprise here) transphobia: people from the trans and lgbtq++ community kept telling us &quot;cisgenders&quot; that not wanting to have sex with a trans person was transphobic, that being attracted to people because of their ethnicity (being particularly attracted to a latina girl, for example) was racist, and that IF I was just tolerant of their gender and nothing else, which means I did not really believe in it but pretended to because I simply didn&#39;t want to hurt that person&#39;s feeling... THEN, I was transphobic.</p>\n\n<p>I said that I had trouble with the concept of gender in general, and that I indeed didn&#39;t want to have sex with a trans person, but that it was my taste, and my own...to which, people told me that it was a transphobic behavior. I also said that I&#39;ll admit taking into account the fact that, before their transition, trans people were either biologically men or women...but apparently they never were to begin with and it&#39;s insulting and oppressive to think so, it would seem that the proper way to say it is that they were &quot;assigned as a man/woman&quot; at birth...the conversation went on and on and on...but I probably shouldn&#39;t have asked so many questions and I definitely shouldn&#39;t have mentioned how I really felt about the entire thing. I didn&#39;t want to hurt anyone, but I can see how it could, since trans people have to deal with people like me all the time: everyone&#39;s patience has a limit.</p>\n\n<p>Later that day, after that debate ended, the people I thought were my friends ended up sending me a message, telling me they didn&#39;t want to hear from me, to talk to me, or to deal with me anymore, because what I said was transphobic, as being tolerant is not good enough, it just doesn&#39;t cut it: if I can&#39;t be &quot;inclusive&quot;, which means convince myself that they&#39;re 100% like any woman out there, which implies that I could have sex with them (or any trans people), then I&#39;m still transphobic, as I&#39;m &quot;denying their very existence&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>So apparently I hurt them...I hurt them a lot, according to them, but their rejection hurt quite a bit as well, as I still care about them.</p>\n\n<p>What should I make of all this, and what should I do?</p>\n\n<p><strong>NB: I just want to clarify, as it&#39;s very important: neither of my friends wanted to have sex with me at all (I&#39;m pretty sure of that), it&#39;s just that:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>1/</strong> for them, not completely accepting them as women, in my mind, was the same as not completely accepting them as women at all, no matter how polite I am and what kind of pronouns I use to respect them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2/</strong>the  &quot;you&#39;re transphobic if you don&#39;t want to have sex with a trans person&quot; part is what I&#39;ve been told by the group we have debates with, and ALTHOUGH my friends were never sexually interested in me, in the first place, they still don&#39;t like that I said that, and see it as another transphobic behavior.</p>\n\n<p>Just wanted to make that clearer, thank you <sup><sup>.</sup></sup></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/lsyzfi/my_friends_told_me_that_im_transphobicbut_am_i/","title":"My friends told me that I'm transphobic...but am I?","tags":["NoStupidQuestions","reddit"],"date":"February 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-26T16:44:31.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-26 16:44","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lsyzfi","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/lsyzfi/my_friends_told_me_that_im_transphobicbut_am_i/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/lsyzfi/my_friends_told_me_that_im_transphobicbut_am_i/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"NoStupidQuestions","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions","author":"JellySea6682","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/JellySea6682","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"JellySea6682","score":127,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我的朋友告诉我，我是变性人......但我是吗？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我的朋友告訴我，我是變性人......但我是嗎？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lsxgo9","excerpt":"In the past few months on YouTube I have seen ads for blatant pyramid schemes,\nget-rich-quick scams which straight up ask for your credit card info,\n“charities” which ask you to “donate” to “sick children” on random dodgy\nwebsites without saying what sickness the child has or why so much money…","slug":"/reddit/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/lsxgo9/why_does_youtube_allow_blatant_scams_to_advertise/","title":"Why does YouTube allow blatant scams to advertise on their platform?
