I&#39;d be sitting in front my screen doing some boring, pointless assignment and would at some point instinctively open Google Maps and start exploring the gorgeous landscapes in Cape Verde/Chile/Australia/wherever. After a few minutes I would melancholically stare at the screen and just imagine being instantly transported there for a few hours, aimlessly walking around and enjoying the peace and quiet away from all the mindless, numbing bullshit of everyday life.
