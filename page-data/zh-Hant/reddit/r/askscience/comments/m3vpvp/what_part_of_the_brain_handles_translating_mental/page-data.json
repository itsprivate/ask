The more things you study/memorize, it actually gets bigger. So if I wanted to learn &quot;How does multiplication work&quot; or &quot;Who are all of the named characters on Game of Thrones,&quot; the hippocampus holds onto that information. </p>\n\n<p>The prefrontal cortex is in charge of short term memory. So let&#39;s assume I already know how multiplication works. And I need to answer the question... </p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;It takes 25 toothpicks to make one Iron Throne replica. It takes 20 more toothpicks to make a second Iron Throne replica that attaches alongside the first one like Legos. And 20 more toothpicks for a third Iron Throne, 20 more for a fourth, on and on. So how many toothpicks will you need to make 21 total Iron Thrones, sandwiched together in a row?&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>The prefrontal cortex is where I would keep track of the figures that tell me &quot;21 Thrones... the first one has 25 toothpicks... so that&#39;s 25 toothpicks plus 20 more Thrones worth of toothpicks... it goes up by 20 each time... 20 times 20 is 400... that&#39;s 400 + 25. That&#39;s 425 toothpicks.&quot; It&#39;s where I juggle the &quot;live calculations.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>But say someone tells me &quot;Now turn that into a math formula that anyone can use to figure out the amount of toothpicks needed for ANY amount of Iron Toothpick Thrones stuck together.&quot; What part of the brain is able to translate logic like that? </p>\n\n<p>A good formula might be &quot;25 + 20(♥-1)&quot; where &quot;♥&quot; is the number of Thrones I need. But just because I can do math in my head doesn&#39;t mean I know how to take that logic and write it down in formula form.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/askscience/comments/m3vpvp/what_part_of_the_brain_handles_translating_mental/","title":"What part of the brain handles translating mental math into written math formulas?","tags":["askscience","reddit"],"date":"March 13, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-13T03:26:07.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-13 03:26","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m3vpvp","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/m3vpvp/what_part_of_the_brain_handles_translating_mental/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/m3vpvp/what_part_of_the_brain_handles_translating_mental/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"askscience","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience","author":"BatSweatpants","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/BatSweatpants","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"BatSweatpants","score":170,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"大脑的哪个部分负责将心算转化为书面数学公式？","the_new_excerpt":"如果我对大脑的理解有误，请停止我。\n\n\n\n海马体是负责长期记忆的。你的事情越多\n学习/记忆，其实会变大。所以，如果我想学习 \"How does\n乘法工作 \"或 \"谁是所有命名的字符在游戏的。\n\"王座\"，海马体掌握着... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"大腦的哪個部分負責將心算轉化爲書面數學公式？","the_new_excerpt":"如果我對大腦的理解有誤，請停止我。\n\n\n\n海馬體是負責長期記憶的。你的事情越多\n學習/記憶，其實會變大。所以，如果我想學習 \"How does\n乘法工作 \"或 \"誰是所有命名的字符在遊戲的。\n\"王座\"，海馬體掌握着... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m3phtr","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/AskReddit/comments/m3phtr/lawyers_of_reddit_which_fictional_villain_would/","title":"Lawyers of Reddit, which fictional villain would you have the easiest time defending?","date":"March 13, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"红网的律师们，你们最容易为哪个虚构的反派辩护？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"紅網的律師們，你們最容易爲哪個虛構的反派辯護？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m3tg3n","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/AskHistorians/comments/m3tg3n/what_did_tolkien_think_of_the_fact_that_led/","title":"What did Tolkien think of the fact that Led Zeppelin wrote several songs about the Lord of the Rings?
