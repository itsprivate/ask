Does it have to do with measuring limitations or architecture, or is the ground there weirdly uniform? </p></li>\n<li><p>If radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer after smoking, why doesn&#39;t the  <a href=\"https://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/28/10/1563.figures-only\">map</a>of worldwide lung cancer cases coincide with the map of most radon heavy countries?  It seems to coincide wholly with countries that smoke heavily and nothing else. I base this one the fact that if you look at second chart, which is lung cancer incidence in females, the lung cancer cases in some countries like Russia, where smoking is much more prevalent among men, drop completely. Whereas lung cancer rates in scandinavia, far and away the most radon heavy place on earth, are not high to begin with.</p></li>\n<li><p>Realistically, how worried should I be living in an orange zone, or even a red zone?</p></li>\n</ol>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/askscience/comments/ltk3dx/questions_about_radon_gas_and_cancer/","title":"Questions about radon gas and cancer?","tags":["askscience","reddit"],"date":"February 27, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-27T12:48:35.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-27 12:48","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ltk3dx","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ltk3dx/questions_about_radon_gas_and_cancer/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ltk3dx/questions_about_radon_gas_and_cancer/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"askscience","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience","author":"Vrindjes","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Vrindjes","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Vrindjes","score":106,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"关于氡气与癌症的问题？","the_new_excerpt":"对不起，名单太长了。当我开始阅读有关氡和癌症的资料时，更多的是...\n问题不断出现。我希望有人在这里是在知道，可以\n回答一些!\n\n 1. 如果氡具有放射性，并在体内留下放射性物质，那么为什么\n    它主要(只)导致肺癌吗？\n\n 2.…","locale":"zh"},{"title":"關於氡氣與癌症的問題？","the_new_excerpt":"對不起，名單太長了。當我開始閱讀有關氡和癌症的資料時，更多的是...\n問題不斷出現。我希望有人在這裏是在知道，可以\n回答一些!\n\n 1. 如果氡具有放射性，並在體內留下放射性物質，那麼爲什麼\n    它主要(只)導致肺癌嗎？\n\n 2.…","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ltf1t7","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/ltf1t7/while_watching_breaking_bad_i_found_myself_asking/","title":"While watching Breaking Bad, I found myself asking something: Why is the purity of meth such a big deal to in the show?
