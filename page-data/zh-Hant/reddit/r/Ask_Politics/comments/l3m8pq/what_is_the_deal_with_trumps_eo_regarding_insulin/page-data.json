Trumpers are going nuts that the insulin EO Trump signed will not go into effect until March 22. That EO basically, if I understand correctly, forces pharmaceutical companies to pass on savings they receive from government, to low income individuals that purchase their insulin. I read that this EO lacked specifics and enforcement mechanisms and would be a bureaucracy nightmare for pharmaceutical companies who are already passing along savings. So this EO might also be a redundancy. And I&#39;ve also read that it needs an act of Congress to do what it is supposed to do. Does anyone know anymore about this EO and why it was frozen?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Ask_Politics/comments/l3m8pq/what_is_the_deal_with_trumps_eo_regarding_insulin/","title":"What is the deal with Trump's EO regarding insulin that Biden just had frozen","tags":["Ask_Politics","reddit"],"date":"January 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-24T14:10:42.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-24 14:10","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l3m8pq","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/l3m8pq/what_is_the_deal_with_trumps_eo_regarding_insulin/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/l3m8pq/what_is_the_deal_with_trumps_eo_regarding_insulin/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Ask_Politics","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics","author":"ParticularGlass1821","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ParticularGlass1821","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"ParticularGlass1821","score":132,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"拜登刚被冻结的胰岛素，特朗普的EO是怎么回事？","the_new_excerpt":"据我了解，罗恩-克莱恩告诉HHS冻结所有特朗普医疗的\nEO还没有生效，所以OMB可以审查它们。特朗普们都快疯了\n特朗普签署的胰岛素EO要到3月22日才会生效。该EO\n基本上，如果我没理解错的话，迫使制药... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"拜登剛被凍結的胰島素，特朗普的EO是怎麼回事？","the_new_excerpt":"據我瞭解，羅恩-克萊恩告訴HHS凍結所有特朗普醫療的\nEO還沒有生效，所以OMB可以審查它們。特朗普們都快瘋了\n特朗普簽署的胰島素EO要到3月22日纔會生效。該EO\n基本上，如果我沒理解錯的話，迫使製藥... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lp3pnw","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/lp3pnw/is_it_just_me_or_does_every_printer_i_ever_buy/","title":"Is it just me or does every printer I ever buy, including expensive ones, just flat out suck?","date":"February 21, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"是我的问题还是我买的每一台打印机，包括昂贵的打印机，都很烂？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"是我的問題還是我買的每一臺打印機，包括昂貴的打印機，都很爛？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lovnsu","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/AskReddit/comments/lovnsu/tourists_of_reddit_what_was_the_most_fucked_up/","title":"Tourists of Reddit, what was the most fucked up think you saw in another country?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 21, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"红网的游客们，你们在其他国家看到的最操蛋的想法是什么？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"紅網的遊客們，你們在其他國家看到的最操蛋的想法是什麼？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-l3m8pq","previousId":"RedditPost-lp3pnw","nextId":"RedditPost-lovnsu","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/Ask_Politics/comments/l3m8pq/what_is_the_deal_with_trumps_eo_regarding_insulin/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
