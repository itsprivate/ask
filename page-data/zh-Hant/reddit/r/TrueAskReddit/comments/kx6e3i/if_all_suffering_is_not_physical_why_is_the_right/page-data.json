There are ongoing discussions around the right to die in terms of euthanasia and suicide as well. I believe that people who have mental illness or have experienced trauma they are unable to live with should be allowed to end their lives-- why is this is a problematic view? I understand that a lot of the right to die literature discusses rational suicide and the concept of making informed rational decisions. But we are depriving people of their reality if we claim that mental illness distorts reality--  it does impact their reality, that is precisely the point. We all have our own realities and for some it is more painful that others. That does not make it less real or rational though.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, some people experience systemic barriers that really diminish their quality of lives and makes things unbearable. Why are those cases left out of consideration?</p>\n\n<p>To be clear I am talking about &quot;while I appreciate and love life, it has been too painful for too long and I have tried several methods to improve things but it has not helped. So I have to leave&quot; vs &quot;I am in pain right now so I must die even though it has not been a long term experience&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/kx6e3i/if_all_suffering_is_not_physical_why_is_the_right/","title":"If all suffering is not physical, why is the right to die not fully extended to people with trauma/mental illness?","tags":["TrueAskReddit","reddit"],"date":"January 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-14T22:10:03.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-14 22:10","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kx6e3i","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/kx6e3i/if_all_suffering_is_not_physical_why_is_the_right/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/kx6e3i/if_all_suffering_is_not_physical_why_is_the_right/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"TrueAskReddit","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit","author":"Aggravating-Goose","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Aggravating-Goose","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Aggravating-Goose","score":131,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"如果所有的痛苦都不是肉体上的，那么为什么死亡权没有充分扩大到有创伤/精神疾病的人？","the_new_excerpt":"我们知道，精神和情感上的痛苦是真实存在的，并具有广泛的影响。\n对一个人的生活质量和周围的人都有影响。有持续的\n在安乐死和自杀方面，围绕死亡权的讨论也是如此。\n我相信，有精神疾病或经历过的人... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"如果所有的痛苦都不是肉體上的，那麼爲什麼死亡權沒有充分擴大到有創傷/精神疾病的人？","the_new_excerpt":"我們知道，精神和情感上的痛苦是真實存在的，並具有廣泛的影響。\n對一個人的生活質量和周圍的人都有影響。有持續的\n在安樂死和自殺方面，圍繞死亡權的討論也是如此。\n我相信，有精神疾病或經歷過的人... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lhhe2x","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/lhhe2x/is_it_me_or_are_people_who_work_really_hard_in/","title":"Is it me or are people who work really hard in their jobs or at school mostly rewarded with....more work?","date":"February 11, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"是我的错，还是那些在工作中或学校里真正努力工作的人，大多会得到....更多的工作回报？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"是我的錯，還是那些在工作中或學校裏真正努力工作的人，大多會得到....更多的工作回報？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lhjvo9","excerpt":"I know in America you have to pay for healthcare and ambulances etc. So I\nwondered if this extends to police services and investigations.\n\nI'm watching 'The vanishing at Cecil hotel' and police are pooling resources\nsuch as sniffer dogs and helicopters and all I can think is if that family has\nto…","slug":"/reddit/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/lhjvo9/in_america_do_you_have_to_pay_for_police_services/","title":"In America, do you have to pay for police services?
