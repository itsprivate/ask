We hear plenty about this in early-modern warfare -- took a musket ball to the pinky toe, cut off the leg to ward off gangrene (perhaps a slight embellishment) -- but I realized I don&#39;t hear very much about male Roman citizens dying en masse from shaving.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, with unclean water, no antibiotics, and razors that almost certainly were less gentle, uniform and delicate (and less clean) than my factory-mass-produced Gillettes, it&#39;d seem to me rather likely that minor shaving wounds would occur often, and that they might well become infected with ease and progress to death (especially as you can&#39;t amputate the head as easily as you can a limb -- or at least not without causing unintended side effects such as death). </p>\n\n<p>I know republican and early imperial Rome had a particular stylistic emphasis on clean-shaven males, to the point of wearing a moustache being seen (if I understand correctly) as a clear political/ethnic statement on Gallic/Germanic heritage. So let&#39;s take them as an example. What gives? Were they really dropping like flies from shaving, quaking in fear at the thought of their bathroom in the morning?</p>\n\n<p>Put another way, why would any culture with even the most basic understanding of wound infection (which the Romans certainly had -- get wound, starts going all smelly, bad news) promote a stylistic motif like shaving that would kill significant amounts of its adherents?</p>\n\n<p>Or, perhaps I&#39;ve missed something, and the reason I don&#39;t hear about the tragic shaving death of 35% of Rome&#39;s emperors is because it didn&#39;t happen, and my initial premise is faulty -- shaving and other trivial wounds didn&#39;t result in infection, perhaps, or they knew how to combat minor infections of that variety. I don&#39;t know.</p>\n\n<p>But I&#39;m very curious! Hope someone knows the answer! </p>\n\n<p>Thanks, as ever, <a href=\"/r/AskHistorians\">r/AskHistorians</a>, you are (though it&#39;s oft-said) the best community on Reddit by a country mile.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/AskHistorians/comments/l17qq7/why_did_shaving_nicks_and_other_trivial_wounds/","title":"Why did shaving nicks (and other trivial wounds) not relatively frequently result in death in the ancient world?
