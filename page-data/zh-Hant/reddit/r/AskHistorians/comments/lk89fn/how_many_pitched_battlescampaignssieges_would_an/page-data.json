This struck me as a little surprising, since I could easily imagine that a single campaign would involve multiple pitched battles, to say nothing of the long skirmishes, sieges, and harassment of enemy/local forces that would be 90% of the time spent campaigning.</p>\n\n<p>So here&#39;s a long multi-part question, specifically regarding around late 1100s to late 1400s:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>How exactly do you define a pitched battle? What draws the line between pitched battle and a skirmish?</li>\n<li>How many would campaigns an average men-at-arms/semi-professional soldier be called upon in their career?</li>\n<li>How many pitched battles, sieges, skirmishes, etc each would a campaign consist of?</li>\n<li>How did all of the above vary across region and time, and war? I would imagine most conflicts were mostly &#39;lets gather a few thousand men and loot some towns/villages&#39;, but a long campaign to reclaim Jerusalem or later when the Italian wars rolled around seems very different to me.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Bonus: all roads lead to Rome, so how many battles would a professional soldier of ~200 AD Rome see in their career?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/AskHistorians/comments/lk89fn/how_many_pitched_battlescampaignssieges_would_an/","title":"How many pitched battles/campaigns/sieges would an average soldier see in their career in different time periods?","tags":["AskHistorians","reddit"],"date":"February 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-15T17:05:48.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-15 17:05","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lk89fn","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/lk89fn/how_many_pitched_battlescampaignssieges_would_an/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/lk89fn/how_many_pitched_battlescampaignssieges_would_an/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"AskHistorians","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians","author":"arcane_in_a_box","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/arcane_in_a_box","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"arcane_in_a_box","score":101,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"一个普通士兵在不同时期的职业生涯中，会看到多少场坑爹的战役/战役/攻坚战？","the_new_excerpt":"所以，我刚才看了https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAYsVjKd5yY，那里是。\n顺带一提，一个55年的百年战争老兵只见过3\n在他的整个职业生涯中，投出的战役。这让我觉得有些意外。\n因为我可以很容易想象，一个活动会涉及... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"一個普通士兵在不同時期的職業生涯中，會看到多少場坑爹的戰役/戰役/攻堅戰？","the_new_excerpt":"所以，我剛纔看了https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAYsVjKd5yY，那裏是。\n順帶一提，一個55年的百年戰爭老兵只見過3\n在他的整個職業生涯中，投出的戰役。這讓我覺得有些意外。\n因爲我可以很容易想象，一個活動會涉及... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lkbib5","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/AskHistorians/comments/lkbib5/was_dungeons_and_dragons_popular_behind_the_iron/","title":"Was Dungeons and Dragons popular behind the Iron Curtain in countries like Poland, East Germany, and the Soviet Union?
