And if so, was this just an empty ideal (as it was for my g-g-grandfather), or did it ever actually happen that being a Mason protected people during the war or led to bonding between people on opposing sides? Or was it the case that most Masons were so patriotic as to value their allegiances in the war over any potential links with Masons from other countries?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/AskHistorians/comments/m1dx3q/my_german_greatgreatgrandfather_refused_to/","title":"My German great-great-grandfather refused to evacuate Poland at the end of WWII as he believed there would be fellow Freemasons in the Red Army who would recognise him.
