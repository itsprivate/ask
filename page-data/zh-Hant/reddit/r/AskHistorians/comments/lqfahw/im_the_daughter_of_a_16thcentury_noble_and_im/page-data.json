In Europe, so-called “piss prophets” claimed to be able to  diagnose many different conditions and diseases by the color of urine.  In a 1552 text, pregnancy urine was described as: “clear pale lemon  color leaning toward off-white, having a cloud on its surface.” Other  tests included mixing wine with urine and observing the results. Indeed,  alcohol reacts with certain proteins in urine, so this may have had a  moderate success rate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This claim is repeated across various popular history websites, but I can&#39;t find its original source. I was wondering if any experts in women&#39;s history could shed light on the subject. I understand that &quot;16th-century noble&quot; is rather vague but I would be interested in responses regarding any relevant geographic location or time period.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/AskHistorians/comments/lqfahw/im_the_daughter_of_a_16thcentury_noble_and_im/","title":"I'm the daughter of a 16th-century noble and I'm concerned that an extramarital tryst may have resulted in pregnancy.
