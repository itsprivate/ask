I&#39;m curious how accurate that picture really is. </p>\n\n<p>How would an average young heterosexual couple, perhaps aged about 20, in pre-World War II America (maybe late 19th/early 20th centuries) have approached sexual intimacy? What would their expectations surrounding intimacy be with each other? Especially as their relationship grew more serious. Let&#39;s say they were in a loving relationship and on trajectory for an engagement and then marriage. Would they both have the expectation that there would be absolutely no physical intimacy between them until their wedding night? Or would they expect a gradual increase in physical intimacy as their relationship progressed. Perhaps they would see sexual intercourse as off-limits until marriage because the lack of reliable contraception, but would they expect other things such as cuddling, &quot;feeling up&quot;, manual sex, or oral sex before their marriage? If so, at what point along their timeline of courting, engagement, and marriage would they expect those things? Is there a point where they would expect to progress to intercourse, perhaps after their engagement? Would they talk about this with each other, as couples often do today? </p>\n\n<p>What would their families think? Would parents try to prevent them from having time alone? Or would the parents have the opinion (as most parents do today), of &quot;Oh, they&#39;re engaged, it&#39;s all right if they engage in sexual intimacy as long as they don&#39;t risk an unplanned pregnancy.&quot; Or even, &quot;it&#39;s all right if they&#39;re having intercourse because they&#39;re already engaged and going to be married next month anyways&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>And how might this differ between social classes, by region, by religion, etc.? </p>\n\n<p>I realize this was such a taboo at that time, that there might not even be good reliable sources about it. Perhaps only people&#39;s personal journals or letters detailing their thoughts and personal experiences.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/AskHistorians/comments/ljic4y/how_would_an_average_young_american_couple/","title":"How would an average young American couple, pre-Sexual Revolution and pre-reliable contraception, have approached sexual intimacy as their relationship became more committed and serious?","tags":["AskHistorians","reddit"],"date":"February 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-14T08:52:44.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-14 08:52","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ljic4y","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ljic4y/how_would_an_average_young_american_couple/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ljic4y/how_would_an_average_young_american_couple/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"AskHistorians","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians","author":"huckleberryfawn","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/huckleberryfawn","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"huckleberryfawn","score":101,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"一对普通的美国年轻夫妇，在性革命前和可靠避孕前，当他们的关系变得更加坚定和认真时，他们会如何对待性亲密关系？","the_new_excerpt":"我们有这样的文化形象，一对60年代前的夫妇在他们的婚姻中一直保持着处女之身。\n新婚之夜，陪嫁的日期和手持猎枪的父亲。我很好奇\n这张图到底有多准确。\n\n一对普通的年轻异性情侣，也许年龄在20岁左右，会如何看待这个问题呢？\n二战前的美国...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"一對普通的美國年輕夫婦，在性革命前和可靠避孕前，當他們的關係變得更加堅定和認真時，他們會如何對待性親密關係？","the_new_excerpt":"我們有這樣的文化形象，一對60年代前的夫婦在他們的婚姻中一直保持着處女之身。\n新婚之夜，陪嫁的日期和手持獵槍的父親。我很好奇\n這張圖到底有多準確。\n\n一對普通的年輕異性情侶，也許年齡在20歲左右，會如何看待這個問題呢？\n二戰前的美國...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m5k866","excerpt":"The 1980s have this really weird trend in entertainment of like, muscular\nHerculean male action heroes.
