Movies like Dances with Wolves, Last of the Mohicans, Free Willy, and dozens of other big movies were focused on telling Native American stories.  And then all the actors from those movies all started getting cast in everything else.  Just watched Die Hard with a Vengeance and one of the NYC cops is a Native American actor and I realized how “90s” that was.  Natural Born Killers is maybe the most 90s movie ever and of course there’s all kinds of Native American imagery and characters.</p>\n\n<p>And then TV seemed to also be doing the same thing.  Recently watched Star Trek: Voyager, which had Chakotay.  And I generally just remember all the random tv shows I watched during the 90s would have a Native American themed episode or character or cast member etc.  </p>\n\n<p>Was it just the trend at the time?  Where did that clear focus on Native American characters and casting start?  And why did it seem to end in the Bush era?  Was there a Clinton administration executive order or policy focused on encouraging positive portrayals of natives in popular media?  Or was it just that Hollywood saw that Native American stuff was making money and winning awards so everyone rushed to get on the bandwagon?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/AskHistorians/comments/lbvbux/was_there_any_particular_reason_that_native/","title":"Was there any particular reason that Native American subjects and characters and actors were so popular in 1990s film and television?
