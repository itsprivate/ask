This seems obvious: most of Russia is freezing cold Siberian land. It makes sense that an east so vast and hostile wouldn’t be <em>densely</em> populated. </p>\n\n<p>However, taking this into consideration, it’s actually more surprising to me just how heavily populated this country as a whole is. Sure, the east is pretty vast and <em>relatively</em> empty, but Russia’s total population is still the 9th largest on earth. This is for a country that is far north in Europe with no real natural barriers to protect them from neighbouring countries. On top of this, the country has a pretty harsh climate besides their land in the south, though most of the population seems concentrated more north. </p>\n\n<p>So how is this the case? Why is it that Russia - remote, unprotected, with an overwhelmingly harsher climate than most of Europe - has such a gigantic population?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/AskHistorians/comments/la5qdd/how_is_russia_a_country_far_north_with_freezing/","title":"How is Russia, a country far north with freezing temperatures, so heavily populated?","tags":["AskHistorians","reddit"],"date":"February 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-01T19:54:56.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-01 19:54","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"la5qdd","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/la5qdd/how_is_russia_a_country_far_north_with_freezing/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/la5qdd/how_is_russia_a_country_far_north_with_freezing/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"AskHistorians","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians","author":"garmack","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/garmack","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"garmack","score":115,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"俄罗斯是一个遥远的北方国家，天寒地冻，怎么会有这么多的人口？","the_new_excerpt":"所以每当我研究这个问题的时候，我发现的都是一堆问题，为什么？\n相对于他们庞大的国土面积来说，俄罗斯的人口太少了。这\n似乎是显而易见的：俄罗斯大部分地区是冰冷的西伯利亚土地。这是有道理的\n东方如此辽阔，充满敌意，却没有密密麻麻... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"俄羅斯是一個遙遠的北方國家，天寒地凍，怎麼會有這麼多的人口？","the_new_excerpt":"所以每當我研究這個問題的時候，我發現的都是一堆問題，爲什麼？\n相對於他們龐大的國土面積來說，俄羅斯的人口太少了。這\n似乎是顯而易見的：俄羅斯大部分地區是冰冷的西伯利亞土地。這是有道理的\n東方如此遼闊，充滿敵意，卻沒有密密麻麻... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lwkfh8","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/lwkfh8/is_anyone_else_having_mixed_feelings_about_the/","title":"Is anyone else having mixed feelings about the world going back to “normal”?
