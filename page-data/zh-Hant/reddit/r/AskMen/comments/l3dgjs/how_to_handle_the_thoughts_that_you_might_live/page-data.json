When I  say for a long time, I never had someone at all. So instead, I put the  time spent browsing dating apps and checking dating advice into doing  something good for other people, I thought that if I couldn&#39;t find  someone to share life with, at least I could make a stranger&#39;s life  better.</p>\n\n<p>Now I&#39;m working with  disabled kids/adults and it&#39;s pretty damn great. I volunteer for the  homeless too and, again, I really like it.</p>\n\n<p>But when I see friends longing for a SO or listen to radio songs, I just  have to wonder how it feels to be wanted, and how this life is going to  end. I don&#39;t know the future, but with my streak I&#39;d like to have a  correct life even if it&#39;s spent alone. And so far, I think I managed  that.</p>\n\n<p>To be honest, I&#39;m really  scared for when I will be older. I&#39;m fit and healthy now, but as I age  that&#39;s going to change. I  don&#39;t want to be the old guy all alone at the end of a retirement home that never has any visit and looks out of the window hoping for a meteor crash. I don&#39;t want a SO just to have her take care of me mind you, it&#39;s just that growing old together sounds better than alone.</p>\n\n<p>So, guys that dealt with similar thoughts, how did you handle it?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: To the dating coaches pouncing on the occasion of a thread with loners, kindly go be carrion eaters somewhere else.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/AskMen/comments/l3dgjs/how_to_handle_the_thoughts_that_you_might_live/","title":"How to handle the thoughts that you might live the rest of your life alone?","tags":["AskMen","reddit"],"date":"January 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-23T20:17:36.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-23 20:17","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l3dgjs","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/l3dgjs/how_to_handle_the_thoughts_that_you_might_live/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/l3dgjs/how_to_handle_the_thoughts_that_you_might_live/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"AskMen","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen","author":"ConflictTerrible","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ConflictTerrible","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"ConflictTerrible","score":8088,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"如何处理自己可能会孤独终老的想法？","the_new_excerpt":"我不久前才满40岁，所以这可能是我为什么会想得更多。\n这个。\n\n关于我的一些情况，我在交友和爱情中挣扎了很久。当我说为\n很长一段时间，我根本就没有人。所以，我反而把时间花在\n浏览约会的应用程序和检查约会的建议到做...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"如何處理自己可能會孤獨終老的想法？","the_new_excerpt":"我不久前才滿40歲，所以這可能是我爲什麼會想得更多。\n這個。\n\n關於我的一些情況，我在交友和愛情中掙扎了很久。當我說爲\n很長一段時間，我根本就沒有人。所以，我反而把時間花在\n瀏覽約會的應用程序和檢查約會的建議到做...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lobwof","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/AskWomen/comments/lobwof/whos_that_one_person_you_dislike_but_youd_never/","title":"Who's that one person you dislike, but you'd never admit it to the world?","date":"February 21, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"你不喜欢的那个人是谁，但你永远不会向全世界承认？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"你不喜歡的那個人是誰，但你永遠不會向全世界承認？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-loakw2","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/AskWomen/comments/loakw2/what_are_signs_of_healthy_vs_unhealthy_boundaries/","title":"What are signs of healthy vs unhealthy boundaries?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 21, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"健康与不健康的界限有哪些迹象？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"健康與不健康的界限有哪些跡象？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-l3dgjs","previousId":"RedditPost-lobwof","nextId":"RedditPost-loakw2","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/AskMen/comments/l3dgjs/how_to_handle_the_thoughts_that_you_might_live/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
