Like when I was a teenager/in college it seems like I had so much ambition and potential and I legitimately enjoyed helping people and volunteering and going on mission trips and learning new things and shit like that. But then life kicked me in the dick a few times and now I just don&#39;t give a fuck about anyone or anything anymore. </p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s not like I&#39;m just an asshole to everybody. I&#39;m still polite and try to be cordial with people or whatever, but all that&#39;s pretty much just a façade. There&#39;s just nothing that I care that much about now and my tolerance for dealing with people&#39;s bullshit has decreased dramatically and I&#39;m not afraid to show it. </p>\n\n<p>On paper of course my life isn&#39;t actually that terrible all things considered. It&#39;s just...idk, unfulfilling? dissatisfiying? Certainly nothing close to what I always imagined or wanted for my future.<br/>\nNow I don&#39;t even know what I want anymore or how to possibly get anywhere else. After constant failure and rejection in pretty much everything I&#39;ve tried, I haven&#39;t accomplished anything worthwhile and just don&#39;t really fucking care anymore 🤷‍♂️</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/AskMen/comments/l6ff7l/how_do_you_keep_yourself_from_turning_into_a/","title":"How do you keep yourself from turning into a bitter, grumpy old man?","tags":["AskMen","reddit"],"date":"January 28, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-28T01:10:05.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-28 01:10","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l6ff7l","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/l6ff7l/how_do_you_keep_yourself_from_turning_into_a/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/l6ff7l/how_do_you_keep_yourself_from_turning_into_a/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"AskMen","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen","author":"whofuckingcares42069","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/whofuckingcares42069","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"whofuckingcares42069","score":278,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"如何让自己不变成一个苦大仇深的老人？","the_new_excerpt":"我才接近30岁，但我已经能感觉到自己开始变得。\n消耗着苦涩和冷漠。就像我十几岁/大学时一样，它\n似乎我有这么多的野心和潜力，我合法地喜欢上了\n帮助别人，做志愿者，去传教，学习... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"如何讓自己不變成一個苦大仇深的老人？","the_new_excerpt":"我才接近30歲，但我已經能感覺到自己開始變得。\n消耗着苦澀和冷漠。就像我十幾歲/大學時一樣，它\n似乎我有這麼多的野心和潛力，我合法地喜歡上了\n幫助別人，做志願者，去傳教，學習... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lsjsbf","excerpt":"I got worried about this watching Canine Intervention this morning.","slug":"/reddit/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/lsjsbf/do_protection_dogs_who_have_to_bite_people_in/","title":"Do protection dogs, who have to bite people in bite suits, end up hating fat people?","date":"February 26, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"穿着咬人服还要咬人的保护犬，最后会不会讨厌胖子？","the_new_excerpt":"今天早上看《犬类干预》，我就很担心这个问题。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"穿着咬人服還要咬人的保護犬，最後會不會討厭胖子？","the_new_excerpt":"今天早上看《犬類干預》，我就很擔心這個問題。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lsiwp8","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/AskReddit/comments/lsiwp8/how_tired_of_you_of_seeing_the_same_post_multiple/","title":"How tired of you of seeing the same post multiple times as you scroll through reddit?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 26, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"当你浏览reddit时，多次看到同样的帖子，你有多累？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"當你瀏覽reddit時，多次看到同樣的帖子，你有多累？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-l6ff7l","previousId":"RedditPost-lsjsbf","nextId":"RedditPost-lsiwp8","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh-Hant","hrefLang":"zh-Hant","originalPath":"/reddit/r/AskMen/comments/l6ff7l/how_do_you_keep_yourself_from_turning_into_a/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
