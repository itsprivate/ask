From a religious perspective, actions in line with these principles are objectively good because they please god. But without religion, are there any real grounds for saying that a just act is somehow better than an unjust one? Or that serving others is better than serving self? Couldn&#39;t these principles be reduced to modes of behavior people tend to like?\nI am familiar with plato&#39;s argument in the republic that justice is beneficial to the individual and society as a whole, but I don&#39;t really find it all that convincing (as grounds for cleaning that justice is &quot;good&quot; and injustice is &quot;bad&quot;), so I am more interested in theories that don&#39;t rely on self-benefit (Or perhaps something more convincing than plato).</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/askphilosophy/comments/l57zlp/how_can_morals_exist_without_religion/","title":"(How) Can morals exist without religion?","tags":["askphilosophy","reddit"],"date":"January 26, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-26T19:42:37.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-26 19:42","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l57zlp","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/l57zlp/how_can_morals_exist_without_religion/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/l57zlp/how_can_morals_exist_without_religion/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"askphilosophy","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy","author":"JARVIS__78","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/JARVIS__78","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"JARVIS__78","score":143,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"(如何)没有宗教，道德可以存在吗？","the_new_excerpt":"我最近离开了基督教，这是我正在努力解决的主要问题。\n与。以至少在我看来，两个基本的 \"道德 \"标准是什么？\n大多数人认为：金科玉律和正义/公平。从宗教\n角度，符合这些原则的行为客观上是好的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"(如何)沒有宗教，道德可以存在嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"我最近離開了基督教，這是我正在努力解決的主要問題。\n與。以至少在我看來，兩個基本的 \"道德 \"標準是什麼？\n大多數人認爲：金科玉律和正義/公平。從宗教\n角度，符合這些原則的行爲客觀上是好的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lr90yh","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/AskReddit/comments/lr90yh/people_who_ended_a_relationship_because_reddit/","title":"People who ended a relationship because Reddit told them to, do you regret it?
