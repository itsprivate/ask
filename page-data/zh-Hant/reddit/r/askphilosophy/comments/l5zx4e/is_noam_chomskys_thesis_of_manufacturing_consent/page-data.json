But when the state loses the bludgeon, when you can&#39;t control people by force, and when the voice of the people can be heard, you have this problem; it may make people so curious and so arrogant that they don&#39;t have the humility to submit to a civil rule, and therefore you have to control what people think...</em></p>\n\n<p><em>And the standard way to do this to resort to what in more honest days used to be called propaganda, manufacture of consent, creation of necessary illusions, various ways of either marginalizing the general public, or reducing them to</em> <strong><em>apathy.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Chomsky&#39;s notion is that people, when left to their devices, will systematically look for ways to subvert authority, and in order to make sure people either can&#39;t coalesce into a solidly united movement with definitive values, or cannot agree among themselves who the real abusers of authority and power are, those with the power to control media narratives seek to instill apathy within the consumers of media.</p>\n\n<p>But this seems at odds with what we now know about headlines and similar content on the internet that goes viral. Media companies want eyes on their pages so that they can sell advertising space. This viewership is measured by the number of &quot;clicks&quot; a title or thumbnail can generate. The studies measuring clickbait efficacy have shown over and over again that titles which agitate, prod, beget controversy, or overall foster an emotion of anger produce the most &quot;clicks&quot;, and hence are progenerated on media platforms the most. This is not congruent with the claim that media&#39;s role in a democracy is to produce apathy.</p>\n\n<p>In fact it seems to be obvious that much of the pre-internet media industry was comfortable tuning into people&#39;s youthful needs to be rebellious, curious, and in opposition to authority. I recall my parents attempt to shelter me from pop-media because, according to their view of the world, pop-culture narrative prevalent in media exercised no restraint ridiculing politicians, conflating success with greed, painting cops as squares, or otherwise encouraging alternate modes of thought from old-fashioned ideas. It&#39;s probably apparent that my parents were deeply conservative. Still, I would hardly call their worldview and the entire Trump camp the product of apathy.</p>\n\n<p>I think there is deeper evidence against Chomsky&#39;s assertion that narratives are systematically controlled in the mere existence of Q-Anon. Not only are the successful narratives provocative, they aren&#39;t even centralized. Q-Anon was devised by a number of independent propagandists who took advantage of an overlooked consequence of the internet: In some places, every user is assumed to be a trusted user. A movement which led to a third of the United States believing that November&#39;s democratic elections were fraudulent took over the Republican party without even requiring vetted professionals, cited documentation, or a platform. I took logic and linguistics in college and respect the importance of Chomsky&#39;s contribution to the sciences, but on the other hand I can&#39;t help but feel that <em>Manufacturing Consent</em> is a piece of fear-mongering propaganda itself.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/askphilosophy/comments/l5zx4e/is_noam_chomskys_thesis_of_manufacturing_consent/","title":"Is Noam Chomsky's thesis of Manufacturing Consent at odds with the data we have with respect to Social Media's impact on the psyche?","tags":["askphilosophy","reddit"],"date":"January 27, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-27T20:37:45.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-27 20:37","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l5zx4e","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/l5zx4e/is_noam_chomskys_thesis_of_manufacturing_consent/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/l5zx4e/is_noam_chomskys_thesis_of_manufacturing_consent/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"askphilosophy","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy","author":"Mapverse1","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mapverse1","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Mapverse1","score":142,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"诺姆-乔姆斯基的 \"制造同意 \"的论述与我们掌握的关于社交媒体对心理的影响的数据是否有出入？","the_new_excerpt":"每乔姆斯基谈《制造同意》题目的由来\n[https://youtu.be/EuwmWnphqII?t=1508]。\n\n在军事国家或封建国家，或你们今天所说的... ...\n极权主义者的国家，人们怎么想并不重要，因为你已经... ...\n得到了一个打击他们的头，你... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"諾姆-喬姆斯基的 \"製造同意 \"的論述與我們掌握的關於社交媒體對心理的影響的數據是否有出入？","the_new_excerpt":"每喬姆斯基談《製造同意》題目的由來\n[https://youtu.be/EuwmWnphqII?t=1508]。\n\n在軍事國家或封建國家，或你們今天所說的... ...\n極權主義者的國家，人們怎麼想並不重要，因爲你已經... ...\n得到了一個打擊他們的頭，你... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lsdn7i","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/askscience/comments/lsdn7i/why_do_giraffes_only_live_for_25_years_but/","title":"Why do Giraffes only live for 25 years but Elephants live upto 70 years even though they both share similar diets, size and live in the same parts of the world?","date":"February 25, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"为什么长颈鹿的寿命只有25年，而大象的寿命却高达70年，尽管它们的饮食、体型都很相似，而且生活在世界的同一地区？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼長頸鹿的壽命只有25年，而大象的壽命卻高達70年，儘管它們的飲食、體型都很相似，而且生活在世界的同一地區？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lsbir8","excerpt":"I've read that young, healthy people are more likely to experience side effects\nfrom the COVID vaccines because of a robust immune response.
