The problem however, is i am getting roped in to each philosophers beliefs once I read them, even though my philosophy teacher has shown the blatant issues he sees with them. For example, we read about Rousseau and Hobbes, and at first I got a long nicely with hobbes, then I started to get along with Rousseau. My professor then went and showed how both are wrong in a lot of ways  (right in others) while pointing at the current modern day evidence that we have of earlier humans. The problem i found in that example and other philosophers is that when I was reading them, I was falling into their line of thinking. Not to say I didn&#39;t have issues with what they said, but their overarching point I was starting to believe. Another trap that I notice a lot of people fall into when reading philosophers is that they believe them when they agree with their worldviews. Like how a libertarian would fall for Locke or how a Communist would fall for Rousseau. I am a bit irrational in that I want to find the inherent truths through philosophy and science even if it seems they are wrong overtime. I want to fall for philosophers that are closer to the truth then others, whom seem to have a better understanding of our world then others. But I am so dumb in that I fall for the wrong philosophers constantly and dont use my intelligence and my understanding of philosophers/philosophy to see the issues of philosophers I like with my own mind instead of relying on those smarter then me. I dont know, some advice would be great, I really want to get into this subject while not losing my grip on reality (if I ever had one)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/askphilosophy/comments/lgbgqz/how_can_i_read_philosophers_without_getting_roped/","title":"How can I read philosophers without getting roped in to their beliefs?","tags":["askphilosophy","reddit"],"date":"February 10, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-10T03:10:26.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-10 03:10","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lgbgqz","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/lgbgqz/how_can_i_read_philosophers_without_getting_roped/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/lgbgqz/how_can_i_read_philosophers_without_getting_roped/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"askphilosophy","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy","author":"Joeman720","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Joeman720","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Joeman720","score":102,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"如何才能读懂哲学家，而不被他们的信仰所迷惑？","the_new_excerpt":"所以我真的开始接触哲学了，因为我现在正在考研。\n现代哲学课程。然而，问题是我被卷入到每一个。\n哲学家的信仰，我一读就懂，尽管我的哲学老师已经。\n显示了他所看到的公然的问题。例如，我们读...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"如何才能讀懂哲學家，而不被他們的信仰所迷惑？","the_new_excerpt":"所以我真的開始接觸哲學了，因爲我現在正在考研。\n現代哲學課程。然而，問題是我被捲入到每一個。\n哲學家的信仰，我一讀就懂，儘管我的哲學老師已經。\n顯示了他所看到的公然的問題。例如，我們讀...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m1w85c","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/AskReddit/comments/m1w85c/serious_why_do_you_buy_onlyfans_content_when/","title":"[Serious] Why do you buy OnlyFan’s content when adult content is available online for free?","date":"March 10, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"正经]网上有免费的成人内容，为什么还要买OnlyFan的内容？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"正經]網上有免費的成人內容，爲什麼還要買OnlyFan的內容？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m1t49g","excerpt":"I will be on my own for my birthday and I would love some ideas!
