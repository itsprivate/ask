I have seen several post&#39;s now on Instagram, Twitter, Tumblr etc. about people saying that Trans Woman also can have their period. No they can&#39;t. They biologically cannot have their Period. It even went so far where i saw posts where Trans Woman took pictures of themselves with fake blood (?) on their underwear saying they had a &quot;accident&quot; and it&#39;s hard being a Woman. I have seen posts from people demanding off time from work once a month because they need that time to feel like a real woman. I&#39;m sorry I but this is straight up mental illness. It would be like a Trans Man can&#39;t come to work because he &quot;Squeezed his balls to hard&quot;. I don&#39;t have aby problems with trans people or  or anyone.
