They swear they&#39;re all being safe and shit. Guess what? We still have incredibly horrible rate of transmission because yall just want to hang out with your friends like nothing is going on. Like would it be soo hard to hold off on that for a month or two, so that we can stop loosing so many people?? We won&#39;t  reach 0 for a good while, but if you could chill the fuck out with your get togethers, we can get to a place where you can have your get togethers without having to come up ith a self-righteous excuse for it.

You need the income.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>EDIT2: Also since it&#39;s come up, I should have said, because mental health is important, if you are in real straits of mental health issues, go see said friend, but also a therapist.
