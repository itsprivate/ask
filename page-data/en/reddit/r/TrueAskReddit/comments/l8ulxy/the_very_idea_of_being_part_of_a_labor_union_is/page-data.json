Work hard and get yours. Government should not be used to alleviate socials ills, but rather, provide people the freedom necessary to pursue their own goals. Conservative policies generally emphasize empowerment of the individual to solve problems on their own.</li>\n<li>On the flip side, liberals, again generally, are more about working together and sharing resources to lift everyone to the top. They believe the role of the government should be to guarantee that no one is in need. Liberal policies generally emphasize the need for the government to solve problems.</li>\n<li>The Republican party has generally been opposed to labor unions because they are used as leverage against businesses.</li>\n<li>Statistically, most business owners are Republican.</li>\n<li>Unions are meant to protect the workers. The very idea of being part of a union is strength in numbers, which, I think, is realistically more liberal in nature than it is conservative.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It seems like almost everything can be viewed this way. A team is always more productive than an individual. The United States itself is a union. No single state would be nearly as wealthy, stable, or immune to foreign influence if not for the the country as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>Is it fair to say that liberalism is the more practiced and favorable ideal? What are you thoughts on this? Is it too simplified?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: It says 3 comments but the only one I see is from the automod.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/l8ulxy/the_very_idea_of_being_part_of_a_labor_union_is/","title":"The very idea of being part of a labor union is strength in numbers.
