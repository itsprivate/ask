I don’t endorse racism of any kind.</p>\n\n<p>I just saw something on Twitter posted by a black user that said how they wanted their women to be accompanied by a picture of three shades of brown. The post has thousands of likes and lots of other black users commenting similar things about how they’ll only date black women. </p>\n\n<p>Now imagine if a white man posted “how I like my women” along with a picture of a white woman or something. That post would immediately be called out as racist, and rightfully so.</p>\n\n<p>But what’s the difference here? Why is one acceptable and the other not instead of both being called out? Why is it okay for POC to blatantly state they choose partners based on skin color instead of that being deemed racist? This is similar to how it feels like a double standard that it’s perfectly okay for POC to make jokes about white teenage boys being mass shooters, but if a white person made a joke about a middle eastern kid being a terrorist they’re immediately racist.</p>\n\n<p>I get that sometimes humor is cathartic, but there’s a line between that and being racist. Again, I don’t think white people should be able to say these things at all, I’m just saying that I don’t understand why we don’t also condemn the same type of behavior from POC.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/l1h2qf/why_is_it_acceptable_for_people_of_color_to_say/","title":"Why is it acceptable for people of color to say things about or against white people that would be deemed racist if the situation was reversed?","tags":["TooAfraidToAsk","reddit"],"date":"January 21, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-21T14:59:08.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-21 14:59","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l1h2qf","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/l1h2qf/why_is_it_acceptable_for_people_of_color_to_say/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/l1h2qf/why_is_it_acceptable_for_people_of_color_to_say/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"TooAfraidToAsk","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk","author":"neuroticsponge","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/neuroticsponge","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"neuroticsponge","score":118,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"为什么有色人种说一些关于或反对白人的话语是可以接受的，而这些话语如果换个情况就会被认为是种族主义的？","the_new_excerpt":"首先我要说的是，我百分百支持平等权利，只是为了\n了解是否有一个双重标准 在这里，或者如果别的东西是怎么回事。I\n不认可任何形式的种族主义。\n\n我只是在Twitter上看到了一个黑人用户发布的东西，说他们如何想要\n他们的女人要...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼有色人種說一些關於或反對白人的話語是可以接受的，而這些話語如果換個情況就會被認爲是種族主義的？","the_new_excerpt":"首先我要說的是，我百分百支持平等權利，只是爲了\n瞭解是否有一個雙重標準 在這裏，或者如果別的東西是怎麼回事。I\n不認可任何形式的種族主義。\n\n我只是在Twitter上看到了一個黑人用戶發佈的東西，說他們如何想要\n他們的女人要...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lm52zu","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/lm52zu/if_someone_changes_gender_its_unacceptable_to/","title":"If someone changes gender it's unacceptable to refer to them as who they presented as years before: you accept them as they are now, so why is it acceptable to refer to an unsavoury tweet from 10 years ago and not accept the person has changed since then and isn't the same person they are now?","date":"February 17, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"如果一个人改变了性别，将他们称为多年前的人是不可接受的：你接受他们现在的样子，那么为什么可以接受提及10年前的一条不堪入目的微博，而不接受这个人从那时起就改变了，不是现在的那个人？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"如果一個人改變了性別，將他們稱爲多年前的人是不可接受的：你接受他們現在的樣子，那麼爲什麼可以接受提及10年前的一條不堪入目的微博，而不接受這個人從那時起就改變了，不是現在的那個人？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lm4pdp","excerpt":"I was reading about 14th C.
