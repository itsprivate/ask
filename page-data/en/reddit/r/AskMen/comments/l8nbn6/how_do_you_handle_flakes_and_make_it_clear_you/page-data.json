We started texting a few months ago, hung out about 4 weeks ago, and I asked her on an official date about 3 weeks ago. After talking she agreed to dinner so we made some plans. </p>\n\n<p>At 5am the day were suppose get dinner she sends me a text that her &quot;mom, sister, and grandma just tested positive for covid and she&#39;s not feeling well.&quot; She asked to hold-off until she could get tested. Fine.</p>\n\n<p>A few days pass and she messages me that she &quot;doesn&#39;t have the rona!&quot; but my week was pretty booked at this point so I told her that. She said she was leaving town for the weekend and would be back Sunday. The vibes I was getting is that she&#39;s not interested so instead of trying to force something on the schedule I just said &quot;okay have fun!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>A few more days pass and she messages me &quot;Hey! I&#39;m not going out of town now this weekend because of the storm. Lunch on Sunday?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I agree. </p>\n\n<p>Sunday morning I text her &quot;Hey! We still on for today?&quot; She responds &quot;Most likely! I&#39;m super hungover and xyz came up that I have to do. Late lunch/early dinner?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I agree.</p>\n\n<p>An hour later she texts me &quot;Hey, I just barfed and I don&#39;t want to keep you waiting. Want to just reschedule?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>If I&#39;m being honest I am a little pissed at this point. I&#39;m self employeed and busy and I&#39;ve now blocked my calendar off for her TWICE with her rescheduling the day of, preventing me from really filling in that time with anything else. Specifically on this last one, I had an offer to leave town for the weekend which I declined because it came after she already asked me to lunch on Sunday. </p>\n\n<p>I was pretty blunt in my response and just told her &quot;I don&#39;t want you puking on me so we can reschedule but, I&#39;m not going to tolerate another reschedule on the next one, okay?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>She responded a day later, I put the ball back in her court, and haven&#39;t heard from her in 4 days now. </p>\n\n<p>I realize I was probably a little blunt/aggressive in my response but I honestly have no time for this shit. </p>\n\n<p>How do you guys normally handle a situation like this? I&#39;m trying to have a little more tact going forward. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/AskMen/comments/l8nbn6/how_do_you_handle_flakes_and_make_it_clear_you/","title":"How do you handle flakes and make it clear you wont tolerate their behavior without making yourself seem like an asshole?","tags":["AskMen","reddit"],"date":"January 31, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-31T01:35:19.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-31 01:35","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l8nbn6","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/l8nbn6/how_do_you_handle_flakes_and_make_it_clear_you/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/l8nbn6/how_do_you_handle_flakes_and_make_it_clear_you/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"AskMen","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen","author":"bor3d-","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/bor3d-","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"bor3d-","score":102,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"你怎么处理这些花花公子，让他们明白你不会容忍他们的行为，同时又不会让自己看起来像个混蛋？","the_new_excerpt":"我去年通过共同的朋友认识了这个女孩。我们开始发了几条短信\n几个月前，挂出约4周前， 我问她在一个正式的日期，\n大约3周前。谈话后，她同意晚餐，所以我们做了一些计划。\n\n在早上5点，我们应该得到晚餐的一天，她给我发了一条短信，她的... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你怎麼處理這些花花公子，讓他們明白你不會容忍他們的行爲，同時又不會讓自己看起來像個混蛋？","the_new_excerpt":"我去年通過共同的朋友認識了這個女孩。我們開始發了幾條短信\n幾個月前，掛出約4周前， 我問她在一個正式的日期，\n大約3周前。談話後，她同意晚餐，所以我們做了一些計劃。\n\n在早上5點，我們應該得到晚餐的一天，她給我發了一條短信，她的... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lv47wo","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/AskReddit/comments/lv47wo/before_hitler_who_was_the_ultimate_evil_figure/","title":"Before Hitler, who was the ultimate evil figure that the whole world collectively would agree upon?","date":"March 01, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"在希特勒之前，谁是全世界集体认同的终极邪恶人物？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"在希特勒之前，誰是全世界集體認同的終極邪惡人物？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lv5w0f","excerpt":"I always have this moment where I think I'm gonna be delivered some really bad\nnews and something horrible has happened.\n\nMost of the time it's not anything to worry about and usually harmless stuff.","slug":"/reddit/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/lv5w0f/does_anyone_feel_anxious_nervous_or_scared_when/","title":"Does anyone feel anxious, nervous or scared when they get a notification or a call from their phone?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 01, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"是否有人在收到手机通知或电话时感到焦虑、紧张或害怕？","the_new_excerpt":"我总是有这样的时刻，我想我会被交付一些非常糟糕的。\n新闻和可怕的事情发生了。\n\n大多数时候都没什么好担心的，通常都是无伤大雅的事情。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"是否有人在收到手機通知或電話時感到焦慮、緊張或害怕？","the_new_excerpt":"我總是有這樣的時刻，我想我會被交付一些非常糟糕的。\n新聞和可怕的事情發生了。\n\n大多數時候都沒什麼好擔心的，通常都是無傷大雅的事情。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-l8nbn6","previousId":"RedditPost-lv47wo","nextId":"RedditPost-lv5w0f","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/AskMen/comments/l8nbn6/how_do_you_handle_flakes_and_make_it_clear_you/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
