Was playing flag football and got hit by an elbow, my tooth went through my lip then I hit the ground and blacked out for a second. Came up bleeding profusely and my friends girlfriend brought me to the hospital. The hospital made her leave because of COVID, but my friends who I drove with just dropped my car off and left even after I asked if one of them could stay to drive me home. Thankfully I am fine after stitches and a CT scan on my head, but it’s the principle that matters to me. If one of them had that happen I would have been there the whole night with/waiting for them. Now it has me reflecting how much more I put into the relationships than they do. I guess it’s better to have no friends than shitty ones.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/AskMen/comments/lbigii/what_was_your_i_need_new_friends_moment/","title":"What was your “I need new friends,” moment?","tags":["AskMen","reddit"],"date":"February 03, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-03T17:26:22.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-03 17:26","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lbigii","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/lbigii/what_was_your_i_need_new_friends_moment/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/lbigii/what_was_your_i_need_new_friends_moment/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"AskMen","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen","author":"Still_Maturing","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Still_Maturing","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Still_Maturing","score":102,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"你说 \"我需要新朋友 \"的时刻是什么？","the_new_excerpt":"我的就发生在现在。在打旗帜足球时，被肘部击中。\n我的牙齿穿过我的嘴唇，然后我撞到地上，昏迷了一秒钟。\n我朋友的女朋友带我去了医院。\n医院让她离开 因为COVID，但我的... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你說 \"我需要新朋友 \"的時刻是什麼？","the_new_excerpt":"我的就發生在現在。在打旗幟足球時，被肘部擊中。\n我的牙齒穿過我的嘴脣，然後我撞到地上，昏迷了一秒鐘。\n我朋友的女朋友帶我去了醫院。\n醫院讓她離開 因爲COVID，但我的... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lxmvqz","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/AskReddit/comments/lxmvqz/which_cultural_norms_have_been_around_for_far_too/","title":"Which cultural norms have been around for FAR too long?","date":"March 05, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"哪些文化规范已经存在了很久？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"哪些文化規範已經存在了很久？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lxp8kj","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/AskReddit/comments/lxp8kj/whats_the_most_bullshit_excuse_you_ever_heard/","title":"What’s the most bullshit excuse you ever heard someone say?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 05, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"你听别人说过的最扯淡的借口是什么？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"你聽別人說過的最扯淡的藉口是什麼？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lbigii","previousId":"RedditPost-lxmvqz","nextId":"RedditPost-lxp8kj","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/AskMen/comments/lbigii/what_was_your_i_need_new_friends_moment/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
