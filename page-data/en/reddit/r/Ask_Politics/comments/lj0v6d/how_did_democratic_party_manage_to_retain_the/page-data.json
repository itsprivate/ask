From 1933 to mid-&#39;90s Democrats have almost never lost the majority position and even got supermajority sometimes. The only time that they&#39;ve lost the majority during that time period was 80th congress (1947-1949), 83rd (1953-1955) during Harry Truman&#39;s presidency. Even when assuming house election favors the opposition party, they didn&#39;t lose majority during the LBJ&#39;s presidency, and Carter&#39;s presidency so my questions are</p>\n\n<p>1) How were they able to retain majority for such a long time</p>\n\n<p>2) How did the Republican presidents such as Ronald Regan, Richard Nixon, Dwight D. Eisenhower able to push their agenda despite not having house approval? Were there a lot of bipartisan bills introduced during that time period?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/Ask_Politics/comments/lj0v6d/how_did_democratic_party_manage_to_retain_the/","title":"How did Democratic party manage to retain the majority in the house for so long from 1930's until mid- 90's?","tags":["Ask_Politics","reddit"],"date":"February 13, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-13T22:38:37.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-13 22:38","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lj0v6d","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/lj0v6d/how_did_democratic_party_manage_to_retain_the/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/lj0v6d/how_did_democratic_party_manage_to_retain_the/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"Ask_Politics","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics","author":"z_tranquil","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/z_tranquil","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"z_tranquil","score":101,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"民主党为什么能从20世纪30年代到90年代中期一直保持在众议院的多数席位？","the_new_excerpt":"我在翻阅众议院的历史和\n按年份划分的多数党，发现了一个有点奇怪的事情。从1933年到\n九十年代中期，民主党几乎从未失去过多数席位，甚至还获得了胜利。\n超级多数有时。唯一的一次，他们已经失去了大多数... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"民主黨爲什麼能從20世紀30年代到90年代中期一直保持在衆議院的多數席位？","the_new_excerpt":"我在翻閱衆議院的歷史和\n按年份劃分的多數黨，發現了一個有點奇怪的事情。從1933年到\n九十年代中期，民主黨幾乎從未失去過多數席位，甚至還獲得了勝利。\n超級多數有時。唯一的一次，他們已經失去了大多數... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m5jqb7","excerpt":"It always struck me as a strange point of reference for the 'best thing'.
