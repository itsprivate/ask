Kylie Jenner Baby post. I feel like this is my biggest reason for my confusion since Instagram doesn&#39;t really have a big &#39;popular content&#39; page, like all the other platforms. People seek that out to like, which i feel like could easily happen with reddit and its Hivemind. </p>\n\n<p>So I guess i just want to know why a website with such an active and connected userbase hasn&#39;t had a post with over a million upvotes yet?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/lzq1jy/why_hasnt_reddit_had_a_post_over_1_million/","title":"Why hasn't reddit had a post over 1 million upvotes/likes by now?","tags":["NoStupidQuestions","reddit"],"date":"March 07, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-07T15:44:50.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-07 15:44","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lzq1jy","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/lzq1jy/why_hasnt_reddit_had_a_post_over_1_million/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/lzq1jy/why_hasnt_reddit_had_a_post_over_1_million/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"NoStupidQuestions","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions","author":"Stefan1414411346","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Stefan1414411346","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Stefan1414411346","score":112,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"为什么到现在reddit还没有一个帖子超过100万的upvotes/likes？","the_new_excerpt":"这个标题真的说得很好。其他各大平台都有多个\n帖子达到100万，有的甚至达到几百万。\n\n似乎没有年龄上的关联性，因为TikTok有数千条帖子超过了100万条。\n万元，其只有在最近两年才真正回升。\n\n我知道Tumblr，这... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼到現在reddit還沒有一個帖子超過100萬的upvotes/likes？","the_new_excerpt":"這個標題真的說得很好。其他各大平臺都有多個\n帖子達到100萬，有的甚至達到幾百萬。\n\n似乎沒有年齡上的關聯性，因爲TikTok有數千條帖子超過了100萬條。\n萬元，其只有在最近兩年才真正回升。\n\n我知道Tumblr，這... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lzmgzr","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/lzmgzr/who_else_isnt_looking_forward_to_working_at_their/","title":"Who else isn't looking forward to working at their regular jobs again when this is all over?","date":"March 07, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"当这一切都结束的时候，还有谁不期待着重新从事自己的固定工作呢？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"當這一切都結束的時候，還有誰不期待着重新從事自己的固定工作呢？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lzndft","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/AskReddit/comments/lzndft/for_people_who_claim_common_masks_do_not_work_why/","title":"For people who claim common masks do not work, why push towards wearing no masks rather than pushing towards better masks?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 07, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"对于宣称普通口罩不起作用的人来说，为什么要推崇不戴口罩，而不是推崇更好的口罩呢？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"對於宣稱普通口罩不起作用的人來說，爲什麼要推崇不戴口罩，而不是推崇更好的口罩呢？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lzq1jy","previousId":"RedditPost-lzmgzr","nextId":"RedditPost-lzndft","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/lzq1jy/why_hasnt_reddit_had_a_post_over_1_million/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
