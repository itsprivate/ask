I know it’s kind of an overused thing to say, but it’s true: if you turn on the radio today you’ll hear almost exclusively rap and pop, maybe EDM if you’re lucky, probably no rock at all unless you’re on a classic rock station. Contrast that to the 1960s-90s, and even the 2000s, it was played everywhere, constantly. I mean countless songs were written specifically about listening to rock music on the radio.
