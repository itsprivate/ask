Multiple people were talking about desensitization and watching brutal stuff. I&#39;m actually desensitized to that stuff as well. For example, I even watched stuff on what used to be <a href=\"/r/watchpeopledie\">r/watchpeopledie</a>. They&#39;re disgusting, appalling things of course, but I don&#39;t as much as blink as that stuff tbh. But show me a hungry puppy or a poor child who only has a single, simple toy that he cherishes, and I&#39;m broken. Gotta block it out of my mind asap or I&#39;ll be super sad.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/lfejt2/is_it_normal_as_a_guy_to_be_absolutely_unable_to/","title":"Is it normal as a guy to be absolutely unable to withstand sad things?
