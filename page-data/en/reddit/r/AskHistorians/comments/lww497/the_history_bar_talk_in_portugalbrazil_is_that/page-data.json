Being Portuguese and having studied in Portugal myself, this was also definitely something my high school history teacher used to say, and we spent quite some time reading up on Portugal‘s historical trade relationship with the UK. In addition, Brazil’s massive gold mines were also discovered precisely at this point in time. A key fact, however, that most people (choose to) ignore is that Portugal pursued this type of deals with Britain to safeguard its sovereignty against French-backed Spanish incursions, especially in Europe, so I already know things aren’t so straightforward to begin with.</p>\n\n<p>But then I wonder - is this really the case? Or Portugal’s squandering of its resources, all flowing to Britain, is overstated? And if so was it that different from what was going on in Spain and the Netherlands, to use two other key colonial players that were also late to the industrialisation game? </p>\n\n<p>I’m asking this because one of the go-to answers out in the street to both Portugal and Brazil’s current-day challenges often boils down to “18th century Portuguese were so dumb they exploited and stripped an entire country of its mineral resources and ended up with nothing to show - unlike the Dutch, for example!”.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/AskHistorians/comments/lww497/the_history_bar_talk_in_portugalbrazil_is_that/","title":"The history “bar talk” in Portugal/Brazil is that Portugal squandered its way out of remaining a global power by using Brazil’s gold to buy “British industrialised goods” and its elite refusing to industrialise the country.
