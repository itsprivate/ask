He was Jewish and his wife was not so his deportation was delayed after a few call-ups but they eventually sent him. I&#39;m wondering why they would have let him go to a hospital in a nearby city. I&#39;m assuming it was most likely just so that he could keep performing labor, but couldn&#39;t they have easily let him die and arrested another person? His career wasn&#39;t in labor and it was fairly shortly after he got to the camp, so I can&#39;t imagine that he would have been particularly &quot;outstanding.&quot; I don&#39;t have many details but I do know for sure that he died in a regular hospital off of the camp. His family was even allowed to visit him in his last moments and my grandmother has told me that while the conditions were awful, the laborers still had communication with home and could even go to the city on the weekends. Why was he taken to the hospital? Why were they fairly &quot;lenient&quot; as opposed to other camps?</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>(Also: very uninterested in any kind of &quot;the Holocaust wasn&#39;t as bad as people think&quot; comments or thoughts.)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/AskHistorians/comments/l41lw4/why_did_the_nazis_let_my_greatgrandfather_go_to/","title":"Why did the Nazis let my great-grandfather go to the hospital?","tags":["AskHistorians","reddit"],"date":"January 24, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-24T19:30:29.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-24 19:30","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l41lw4","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/l41lw4/why_did_the_nazis_let_my_greatgrandfather_go_to/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/l41lw4/why_did_the_nazis_let_my_greatgrandfather_go_to/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"AskHistorians","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians","author":"vr4gen","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/vr4gen","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"vr4gen","score":2968,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"为什么纳粹要让我的曾祖父去医院？","the_new_excerpt":"基本上，我的曾祖父被送去荷兰的一个劳改营，在那里，他的名字是：\"我\"。\n1944年初，他感染了葡萄球菌，导致他27岁时去世。他的\n妻子不是犹太人，所以在几次征召后，他的遣返被推迟了，但他们... ...\n最终把他送走了。我想知道为什么他们会让...
