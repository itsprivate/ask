They call to mind the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistine_Chapel#/media/File:Creaci%C3%B3n_de_Ad%C3%A1m.jpg\">Creation of Adam from the Sistine Chapel</a> which has some similar hand specificity going on. Some later portraits seem to be yet pointier, such <a href=\"https://d3d00swyhr67nd.cloudfront.net/w1200h1200/collection/LW/NARM/LW_NARM_22688-001.jpg\">this example</a> and <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/John_Singleton_Copley_-_General_Thomas_Gage_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg\">this one</a>, both from the 18th century, though these two may both actually be gesturing to stuff, given the subjects are located on battlefields.</p>\n\n<p>Are any of these people actually pointing? If not, is it some kind of stylistic convention to show these people are just sooo relaxed, like <a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d2/8d/41/d28d418579a014c1da4d52c64bfb7951.jpg\">ballet hands</a> or the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa#/media/File:Mona_Lisa,_by_Leonardo_da_Vinci,_from_C2RMF_retouched.jpg\">casual posture of the Mona Lisa</a>? If it is one of those little stylistic conventions that has nothing to do with gesturing at stuff, when did it show up and what, if anything specific, were artists trying to convey with this particular convention? It seems anything but &quot;naturalistic&quot; to my modern eyes, so I&#39;ve assumed that wasn&#39;t the point.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/AskHistorians/comments/lcoqrk/why_do_figures_in_16th18th_century_paintings/","title":"Why do figures in 16th-18th century paintings frequently seem to be pointing at something to the side of the frame, other than to tell us \"shit's on fire, yo\"?","tags":["AskHistorians","reddit"],"date":"February 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-05T03:48:15.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-05 03:48","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lcoqrk","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/lcoqrk/why_do_figures_in_16th18th_century_paintings/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/lcoqrk/why_do_figures_in_16th18th_century_paintings/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"AskHistorians","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians","author":"screwyoushadowban","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/screwyoushadowban","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"screwyoushadowban","score":102,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"为什么16-18世纪的绘画作品中的人物除了告诉我们 \"狗屎着火了哟 \"之外，还经常好像在指着画面一侧的什么东西？","the_new_excerpt":"所以我在一些文艺复兴时期的肖像画中偶尔会注意到这种元素，首先是\n来自于这个备忘录的来源，亚历山德罗-阿洛里的《一个年轻人的肖像》。\n[https://www.wga.hu/art/a/allori/alessand/portrait.jpg]，但也有这样的描述\n苏丹-艾哈迈德-曼苏尔的报告\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmad_al...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼16-18世紀的繪畫作品中的人物除了告訴我們 \"狗屎着火了喲 \"之外，還經常好像在指着畫面一側的什麼東西？","the_new_excerpt":"所以我在一些文藝復興時期的肖像畫中偶爾會注意到這種元素，首先是\n來自於這個備忘錄的來源，亞歷山德羅-阿洛裏的《一個年輕人的肖像》。\n[https://www.wga.hu/art/a/allori/alessand/portrait.jpg]，但也有這樣的描述\n蘇丹-艾哈邁德-曼蘇爾的報告\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmad_al...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lyif8e","excerpt":"On the face of it, it's a pretty stupid question.
