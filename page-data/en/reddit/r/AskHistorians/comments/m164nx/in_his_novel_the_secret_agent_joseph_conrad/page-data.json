And this was strange, since the Italian restaurant is such a peculiarly British institution.  But these people were as denationalised as the dishes set before them with every circumstance of unstamped respectability.  Neither was their personality stamped in any way, professionally, socially or racially.  They seemed created for the Italian restaurant, unless the Italian restaurant had been perchance created for them.  But that last hypothesis was unthinkable, since one could not place them anywhere outside those special establishments.  One never met these enigmatical persons elsewhere.  It was impossible to form a precise idea what occupations they followed by day and where they went to bed at night.  And he himself had become unplaced.  It would have been impossible for anybody to guess his occupation.  As to going to bed, there was a doubt even in his own mind.  Not indeed in regard to his domicile itself, but very much so in respect of the time when he would be able to return there.  A pleasurable feeling of independence possessed him when he heard the glass doors swing to behind his back with a sort of imperfect baffled thud.  He advanced at once into an immensity of greasy slime and damp plaster interspersed with lamps, and enveloped, oppressed, penetrated, choked, and suffocated by the blackness of a wet London night, which is composed of soot and drops of water.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/AskHistorians/comments/m164nx/in_his_novel_the_secret_agent_joseph_conrad/","title":"In his novel \"The Secret Agent\", Joseph Conrad describes Italian restaurants as a \"peculiarly British institution.\" Are these the same Italian restaurants we're familiar with today, and if so when and why did they stop being associated with the United Kingdom?","tags":["AskHistorians","reddit"],"date":"March 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-09T18:33:09.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-09 18:33","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m164nx","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/m164nx/in_his_novel_the_secret_agent_joseph_conrad/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/m164nx/in_his_novel_the_secret_agent_joseph_conrad/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"AskHistorians","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians","author":"TheD3rp","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheD3rp","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"TheD3rp","score":103,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"约瑟夫-康拉德在他的小说《密探》中，将意大利餐厅描述为 \"英国特有的机构\"。这些餐厅是否就是我们今天熟悉的意大利餐厅，如果是的话，它们是什么时候、为什么不再与英国联系在一起？","the_new_excerpt":"以下是该段全文，供参考。\n\n> 在外出时，助理专员对自己提出了这样的意见：\n>该地的顾客在频繁的欺诈性烹饪中失去了。\n> 所有的国家和私人特征。这很奇怪，因为\n>意大利人...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"約瑟夫-康拉德在他的小說《密探》中，將意大利餐廳描述爲 \"英國特有的機構\"。這些餐廳是否就是我們今天熟悉的意大利餐廳，如果是的話，它們是什麼時候、爲什麼不再與英國聯繫在一起？","the_new_excerpt":"以下是該段全文，供參考。\n\n> 在外出時，助理專員對自己提出了這樣的意見：\n>該地的顧客在頻繁的欺詐性烹飪中失去了。\n> 所有的國家和私人特徵。這很奇怪，因爲\n>意大利人...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m0x3hi","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/AskReddit/comments/m0x3hi/whats_your_most_toxic_trait_you_can_admit_to/","title":"What's your most toxic trait you can admit to?","date":"March 09, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"你能承认的最毒的特质是什么？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"你能承認的最毒的特質是什麼？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m16dcr","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/AskHistorians/comments/m16dcr/geopolitical_debates_in_the_19th_century_were/","title":"Geopolitical debates in the 19th century were often framed around “questions” (the Irish Question, the German Question, the Eastern Question, etc.).
