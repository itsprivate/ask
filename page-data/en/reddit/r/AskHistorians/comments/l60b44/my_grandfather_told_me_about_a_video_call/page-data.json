And then he responded with: &quot; You know, we had video call possibilities a long time ago.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>According to him, the procedure was like this: Like any long-distance call, you had to go to the post office. At the post office, you could pick an option to call through a &quot;videocall&quot;, he said that the option was only offered to major cities like Moscow or Leningrad. So, when you got your opportunity to make the video call, you had to go into this little booth, that had a small tv like screen and you could see the person you were talking to. He didn&#39;t remember the exact time when this was but said late 70s early 80s.  </p>\n\n<p>While my grandfather is old, he is surprisingly comprehensive, but I still seem to be skeptical of this possibility.
