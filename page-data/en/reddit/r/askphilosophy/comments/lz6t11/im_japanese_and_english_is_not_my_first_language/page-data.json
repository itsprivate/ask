These were not satire; they were being completely serious.. here is an example of a gender called &#39;&#39;Amongusgender&#39;&#39; that gained a lot of popularity, for example ; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wllburs00t_/status/1305668306616168448?lang=en\">https://twitter.com/wllburs00t_/status/1305668306616168448?lang=en</a></p>\n\n<p>so, in this case, wouldn&#39;t it mean everyone is transgender, because everyone&#39;s moods and interests change all the time?</p>\n\n<p>For example, I am an artist. If I am creating, would I not be &#39;&#39;creativitygender&#39;&#39;, or when I am angry, I am &#39;&#39;angrygender&#39;&#39;? &amp; late at night, I tend to get sleepy. Would that not make me &#39;&#39;sleepygender&#39;&#39;, for example?</p>\n\n<p>There are almost 8 billion people on the planet, all with their own feelings and interests. Thus, are there also at least 8 billion genders as no two people will have the exact same personality or sets of interests?</p>\n\n<p>Note, I am making a sharp distinction between being transgender and transsexual, which is neurological and not a choice (while personality and interests can be choices). A transsexual person changes their sex, but based on what I have read, &#39;&#39;transgender&#39;&#39; is synonymous for &#39;&#39;transmood&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;transemotion&#39;&#39;, or &#39;&#39;transinterest&#39;&#39; but everyone&#39;s moods and interests etc transform all the time. I&#39;m sure there are very, very few people who never have changing moods, emotions, or interests.</p>\n\n<p>In other words; being transgender is literally the most normal/common thing to exist in society, and it&#39;d be weird if it didn&#39;t?</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s my interpretation anyway, Japanese is very different to English language..</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/askphilosophy/comments/lz6t11/im_japanese_and_english_is_not_my_first_language/","title":"I'm Japanese and English is not my first language.
