Arabs are almost entirely Muslims. Italians are mostly Catholic. Russians are Orthodox. Americans are Protestant (except ones descended from Ireland, Italy, Mexico, etc.)</p>\n\n<p>You get the point. But also, when you look at influential philosophers you notice the same trends. Aquinas said Islam was false and Catholicism was true. Ibn Sina assured us that Catholicism was false and Islam was true. Eastern philosophers assure us that both are false and some religion local to them is true, etc.</p>\n\n<p>So when looking at the surface level, I just have the feeling if I’m reading Thomas Aquinas that it’s just an Italian dude justifying Italian beliefs. Ibn Sina is just a Persian dude justifying Persian beliefs. If Aquinas was raised in Persia he’s have been telling me how he reasoned that Islam is the true religion. If Ibn Sina was born in Rome he’d be justifying the trinity to us. So I intuitively am skeptical of religious philosophy like this for these reasons. It just seems so untrustworthy and like it must not be too convincing either way if location is ultimately what determines all these people’s beliefs.</p>\n\n<p>Is that intuition flawed? If so, what’s wrong with it and who are some philosophers who dealt with the idea that people just adopt religions of their area and almost never even consider others.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/askphilosophy/comments/m1hnqw/does_the_way_religious_belief_seems_to_depend_on/","title":"Does the way religious belief seems to depend on your location cast reasonable doubt on the veracity of religious philosophy?","tags":["askphilosophy","reddit"],"date":"March 10, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-10T05:48:33.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-10 05:48","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m1hnqw","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/m1hnqw/does_the_way_religious_belief_seems_to_depend_on/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/m1hnqw/does_the_way_religious_belief_seems_to_depend_on/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"askphilosophy","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy","author":"Caramal76","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Caramal76","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Caramal76","score":101,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"宗教信仰的方式似乎取决于你的位置，是否会对宗教哲学的真实性产生合理怀疑？","the_new_excerpt":"我想我只是在标题中抛出了一些文字沙拉，但基本上我的观点是\n当你审视宗教信仰时，你很快就会发现，它有多大的影响力。\n取决于地点。阿拉伯人几乎都是穆斯林。意大利人主要是\n天主教徒。俄罗斯人是东正教。美国人是新教（除了......）。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"宗教信仰的方式似乎取決於你的位置，是否會對宗教哲學的真實性產生合理懷疑？","the_new_excerpt":"我想我只是在標題中拋出了一些文字沙拉，但基本上我的觀點是\n當你審視宗教信仰時，你很快就會發現，它有多大的影響力。\n取決於地點。阿拉伯人幾乎都是穆斯林。意大利人主要是\n天主教徒。俄羅斯人是東正教。美國人是新教（除了......）。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m1998x","excerpt":"I see it everywhere and i don't know what it means","slug":"/reddit/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/m1998x/what_the_hell_does_based_mean/","title":"What the hell does based mean?","date":"March 10, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"基于的到底是什么意思？","the_new_excerpt":"我到处都能看到，但我不知道是什么意思。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"基於的到底是什麼意思？","the_new_excerpt":"我到處都能看到，但我不知道是什麼意思。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m1lfdy","excerpt":"For instance, I love Mario Kart and battlefront to name a few, but I’ve only\never played against the computer or in the storyline mode.
