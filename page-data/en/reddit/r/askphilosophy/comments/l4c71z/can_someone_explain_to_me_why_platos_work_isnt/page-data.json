I think that through a historical lens, all of the praise that Plato recieves is justified—he was ahead of his time. That being said, I&#39;m completely dumbfounded as to why people would ever, ever recommend Plato for the actual content of his writings, devoid of their historical context.</p>\n\n<p>This is an exerpt from Republic, Book I, starting from 333e:</p>\n\n<p><em>Socrates: &quot;Then, my friend, justice cannot be a thing of much worth if it is useful only for things out of use and useless. But let us consider this point. Is not the man who is most skilful to strike or inflict a blow in a fight, whether as a boxer or elsewhere, also the most wary to guard against a blow?”</em> </p>\n\n<p><em>Polemarchus: “Assuredly.”</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Socrates: “Is it not also true that he who best knows how to guard against disease is also most cunning to communicate it and escape detection?”</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Polemarchus: “I think so.”</em> </p>\n\n<p><em>Socrates: “But again the very same man is a good guardian of an army who is good at stealing a march upon the enemy in respect of their designs and proceedings generally.”</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Polemarchus: “Certainly.”</em> </p>\n\n<p><em>Socrates: “Of whatsoever, then, anyone is a skilful guardian, of that he is also a skilful thief?”</em> </p>\n\n<p><em>Polemarchus: “It seems so.”</em> </p>\n\n<p><em>Socrates: “If then the just man is an expert in guarding money he is an expert in stealing it.”</em> </p>\n\n<p><em>Polemarchus: “The argument certainly points that way.”</em></p>\n\n<p>This point is later ended by the following dialogue:</p>\n\n<p><em>Socrates: So justice, according to you and Homer and Simonides, seems to be a kind of stealing, with the qualification that it is for the benefit of friends and the harm of enemies. Isn&#39;t that what you meant?”</em> </p>\n\n<p><em>Polemarchus: “No, by Zeus,” he replied. “I no longer know what I did mean.&quot;</em></p>\n\n<p>Do I really need to point out how lazy and absurd this conclusion is? The relationship between a skill and an inverse skill just doesn&#39;t apply to moral values or personality traits—&quot;justness&quot; is not a profession. The most introverted person is not also the best at being extraverted. The most charitable grandmother is not the best at being selfish, etc.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t want to harp on too long about this particular exerpt, but I think it does a good job of encapsulating the formula of the arguments in Plato&#39;s work—Socrates draws shifty comparisons to prove or disprove a point, they often go completely unchallenged by the braindead strawmen that he&#39;s arguing with, and at the end they&#39;re left speechless. </p>\n\n<p>There are obviously good bits here and there, but the overwhelming majority of Plato&#39;s works read  like some fantasy he had in the shower of what he <em>wished</em> would&#39;ve said in an argument he had a couple of years ago and can&#39;t stop thinking about for some reason. Am I just crazy here?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/askphilosophy/comments/l4c71z/can_someone_explain_to_me_why_platos_work_isnt/","title":"Can someone explain to me why Plato's work isn't terrible?","tags":["askphilosophy","reddit"],"date":"January 25, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-25T14:12:37.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-25 14:12","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l4c71z","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/l4c71z/can_someone_explain_to_me_why_platos_work_isnt/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/l4c71z/can_someone_explain_to_me_why_platos_work_isnt/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"askphilosophy","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy","author":"Choruzon","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Choruzon","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Choruzon","score":116,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"谁能给我解释一下为什么柏拉图的作品不可怕？","the_new_excerpt":"详解标题。\n\n我知道柏拉图对哲学的发展至关重要，他是\n具有不可思议的历史意义。我认为，从历史的角度来看。\n所有的赞美，柏拉图recieves是有道理的，他是领先于他的时间。\n话虽如此，我完全...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"誰能給我解釋一下爲什麼柏拉圖的作品不可怕？","the_new_excerpt":"詳解標題。\n\n我知道柏拉圖對哲學的發展至關重要，他是\n具有不可思議的歷史意義。我認爲，從歷史的角度來看。\n所有的讚美，柏拉圖recieves是有道理的，他是領先於他的時間。\n話雖如此，我完全...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lq0c4b","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/AskHistorians/comments/lq0c4b/black_panther_members_once_openly_carried/","title":"Black Panther members once openly carried firearms and would stand nearby when the police pulled over a black person.
