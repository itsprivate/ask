It&#39;s been called the revenge of the nerds. How does philosophy respond?  </p>\n\n<p>My gut instinct is a sort of unease. I&#39;m conflicted. Some anxiety, as well. Reflect, on the one hand - the hundreds of millions of working poor suffering from the aftermath of two waves of a global pandemic, fresh new global recession incoming - and on the other hand, a small selection of digital creators who can now sell digital pictures of flowers for $25,000. I&#39;ve read many jubilant claims that this is a revolutionising moment ... but I don&#39;t know what is being revolutionised. Is it not an otherwise revolutionary means of ignoring the ecological impact of crypto? What is it solving? What issues? Or is it an innovative means of ignoring them?   </p>\n\n<p>I suppose a lot of Very Online people feel that this is a turning point in making concrete that which was was abstract in questions of the value of digital labour, especially art, but I don&#39;t know how much of a huge win this is considering how much of modern capitalism is already produced through digital labour. Does this signify anything that might change the ways in which digital labour has been systematically de-valued historically? Is there radical potential for something which is so cripplingly capitalistic? It seems to me, a more complicated yet democratised means of speculation.   </p>\n\n<p>My question is - your opinion on NFTs, and whether you have any philosophical literature which tackles the NFT craze you would like to share? I&#39;m interested in all aspects of the debate, but especially anti-capitalist and post-structural opinions, if there are any yet.   </p>\n\n<p>All the best pangolin,</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/askphilosophy/comments/m5kx1a/nfts_are_stupid_but_why/","title":"NFTs Are Stupid - But Why?","tags":["askphilosophy","reddit"],"date":"March 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-15T23:59:22.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-15 23:59","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m5kx1a","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/m5kx1a/nfts_are_stupid_but_why/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/m5kx1a/nfts_are_stupid_but_why/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"askphilosophy","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy","author":"Best_Pangolin_6534","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Best_Pangolin_6534","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Best_Pangolin_6534","score":102,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"NFTs是愚蠢的--但为什么？","the_new_excerpt":"NFT的狂热席卷了整个网络。被称为宅男的复仇。如何\n哲学的回应？\n\n我的直觉是一种不安。我很矛盾。也有些焦虑。\n反思，一方面--数以亿计的工薪族穷人在受苦受难\n从两波全球金融危机后的...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"NFTs是愚蠢的--但爲什麼？","the_new_excerpt":"NFT的狂熱席捲了整個網絡。被稱爲宅男的復仇。如何\n哲學的迴應？\n\n我的直覺是一種不安。我很矛盾。也有些焦慮。\n反思，一方面--數以億計的工薪族窮人在受苦受難\n從兩波全球金融危機後的...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m5pu42","excerpt":"This question was originally asked by u/zurbzurbzurb [/u/zurbzurbzurb] 3 months\nago but unfortunately received no responses.\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/jvc0l9/15_of_shakespeares_37_plays_feature_suicide_as_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf]\n\nIn addition to…","slug":"/reddit/r/AskHistorians/comments/m5pu42/15_of_shakespeares_37_plays_feature_suicide_as_a/","title":"15 of Shakespeare's 37 plays feature suicide as a significant theme, how common was suicide in everyday life during the Elizabethan Era?","date":"March 15, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"莎士比亚的37部戏剧中，有15部以自杀为重要主题，在伊丽莎白时代，自杀在日常生活中到底有多普遍？","the_new_excerpt":"该问题最初由u/zurbzurb [/u/zurbzurb] 3个月提出。\n前，但遗憾的是没有收到回复。\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/jvc0l9/15_of_shakespeares_37_plays_feature_suicide_as_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf]\n\n除了...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"莎士比亞的37部戲劇中，有15部以自殺爲重要主題，在伊麗莎白時代，自殺在日常生活中到底有多普遍？","the_new_excerpt":"該問題最初由u/zurbzurb [/u/zurbzurb] 3個月提出。\n前，但遺憾的是沒有收到回覆。\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/jvc0l9/15_of_shakespeares_37_plays_feature_suicide_as_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf]\n\n除了...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m5nao0","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/AskHistorians/comments/m5nao0/why_was_julius_caesar_assassinated_on_the_ides_of/","title":"Why was Julius Caesar assassinated on the Ides of March specifically?
