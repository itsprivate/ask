This is super exciting and I&#39;m grateful for that opportunity :) For those not familiar with the competition, both the national olympiad and the international olympiad require students to write a text in English discussing one of four quotes.</p>\n\n<p>Now, English is my second language and all of my philosophy education thus far, except for some individual reading, has all been in Dutch. I think I&#39;m a fairly competent writer overall, but translating the philosophies to English is a bit hard for me because of the amount of jargon that&#39;s used. I guess I mostly think about this stuff in Dutch so my English representation of some ideas is lacking/not really good. That&#39;s why I&#39;d like to explore some of the ideas as they are described in English to get used the &quot;peculiar&quot; (in a positive way) writing style used in philosophy as well as expand my knowledge about philosophy with some more in-depth material than we usually discuss in my high school class. So basically I think I&#39;m looking for an undergraduate level textbook that covers some of the most influential philosophers. I was wondering if anyone had a suggestion for a good book or maybe some resources that could be helpful.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/askphilosophy/comments/ll83hm/undergraduate_level_resources_for_high_school/","title":"Undergraduate level resources for high school student","tags":["askphilosophy","reddit"],"date":"February 17, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-17T11:49:48.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-17 11:49","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ll83hm","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/ll83hm/undergraduate_level_resources_for_high_school/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/ll83hm/undergraduate_level_resources_for_high_school/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"askphilosophy","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy","author":"RickDeveloper","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/RickDeveloper","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"RickDeveloper","score":103,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"高校学生的本科层次资源","the_new_excerpt":"嗨，我的天\n\n我是一名高中生，几周前我获得了全国哲学的冠军\n奥林匹克，这意味着我将会参加国际哲学竞赛\n奥林匹克在五月。这是超级令人兴奋的，我很感激这个机会:)\n对于那些不熟悉比赛的人来说，无论是...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"高校學生的本科層次資源","the_new_excerpt":"嗨，我的天\n\n我是一名高中生，幾周前我獲得了全國哲學的冠軍\n奧林匹克，這意味着我將會參加國際哲學競賽\n奧林匹克在五月。這是超級令人興奮的，我很感激這個機會:)\n對於那些不熟悉比賽的人來說，無論是...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lljkr8","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/lljkr8/why_is_prostitution_illegallike_adults_can_have/","title":"Why is prostitution illegal?Like adults can have sex,and they also can give as much money as they want to whoever they want,at any time.Yet in majority of worlds countries doing this at the same time is a crime.Why?","date":"February 17, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"为什么卖淫是非法的？就像成年人可以发生性关系，他们也可以在任何时候给他们想要的人多少钱，但在世界大多数国家，同时这样做是犯罪。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼賣淫是非法的？就像成年人可以發生性關係，他們也可以在任何時候給他們想要的人多少錢，但在世界大多數國家，同時這樣做是犯罪。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-llm7gd","excerpt":"I’m a Canadian and we are dependent on the EU to ship out the remaining vials of\nthe vaccine as contractually obligated to do so however I’m wondering what’s\nstopping us from creating the vaccines on our home soil when we already have the\nmoderna and Pfizer vaccines that we are currently slowly…","slug":"/reddit/r/askscience/comments/llm7gd/why_cannot_countries_mass_produce_their_own/","title":"Why cannot countries mass produce their own vaccines by “copying the formulae” of the already approved Moderna and Pfizer vaccines?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 17, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"为什么各国不能通过 \"抄袭 \"已经获批的Moderna和辉瑞疫苗的配方来大规模生产自己的疫苗呢？","the_new_excerpt":"我是加拿大人，我们依靠欧盟运送剩余的小瓶的\n疫苗的合同义务，但我想知道什么是......。\n阻止我们在自己的土地上制造疫苗，而我们已经有了。\nmoderna和辉瑞的疫苗，我们目前正在慢慢... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼各國不能通過 \"抄襲 \"已經獲批的Moderna和輝瑞疫苗的配方來大規模生產自己的疫苗呢？","the_new_excerpt":"我是加拿大人，我們依靠歐盟運送剩餘的小瓶的\n疫苗的合同義務，但我想知道什麼是......。\n阻止我們在自己的土地上製造疫苗，而我們已經有了。\nmoderna和輝瑞的疫苗，我們目前正在慢慢... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-ll83hm","previousId":"RedditPost-lljkr8","nextId":"RedditPost-llm7gd","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"en","hrefLang":"en-US","originalPath":"/reddit/r/askphilosophy/comments/ll83hm/undergraduate_level_resources_for_high_school/","dateFormat":"MM/DD/YYYY"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
