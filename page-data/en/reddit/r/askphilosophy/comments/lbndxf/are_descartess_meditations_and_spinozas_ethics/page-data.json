I do not plan on reading his major works until I understand the basics, and I think the rationalist-empiricist debate is a good place to start. I plan to buy a book which has a collection of works by Spinoza, Leibniz and Descartes, in particular, <em>Discourse on Method</em>, <em>Meditations</em>, <em>Ethics</em>, <em>Monadology</em> and <em>Discourse on Metaphysics.</em><br/>\nWould this be a good place to start? Also, should I start with <em>Ethics</em> or <em>Meditations</em>? I have heard people say <em>Ethics</em> is difficult to approach, but coming from a math background I find the structure of the text really interesting. Or should I start with some secondary works? Once I am done with <em>Ethics</em>, should I read Deleuze&#39;s books on Spinoza, or should I keep it for later?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/askphilosophy/comments/lbndxf/are_descartess_meditations_and_spinozas_ethics/","title":"Are Descartes's Meditations and Spinoza's Ethics good entry points in philosophy?","tags":["askphilosophy","reddit"],"date":"February 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-04T07:25:47.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-04 07:25","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lbndxf","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/lbndxf/are_descartess_meditations_and_spinozas_ethics/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/lbndxf/are_descartess_meditations_and_spinozas_ethics/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"askphilosophy","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy","author":"yash404","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/yash404","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"yash404","score":101,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"笛卡尔的《沉思录》和斯宾诺莎的《伦理学》是哲学的好切入点吗？","the_new_excerpt":"大家好。\n我在哲学方面的知识不多，除了SEP/IEP的网页和大量的\n德勒兹的概念让我产生了阅读更多的兴趣。我不打算\n阅读他的主要作品，直到我了解基本的内容，我认为。\n理性主义和经验主义的辩论是一个很好的开始。我打算...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"笛卡爾的《沉思錄》和斯賓諾莎的《倫理學》是哲學的好切入點嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"大家好。\n我在哲學方面的知識不多，除了SEP/IEP的網頁和大量的\n德勒茲的概念讓我產生了閱讀更多的興趣。我不打算\n閱讀他的主要作品，直到我瞭解基本的內容，我認爲。\n理性主義和經驗主義的辯論是一個很好的開始。我打算...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-ly35bo","excerpt":"Hi, this is my first Reddit post.
