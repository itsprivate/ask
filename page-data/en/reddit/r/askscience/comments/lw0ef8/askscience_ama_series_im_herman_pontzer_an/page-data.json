I&#39;m Herman Pontzer, PhD, Associate Professor of Evolutionary Anthropology at Duke University and Associate Research Professor of Global Health at the Duke Global Health Institute. I conduct research on the human metabolism through studies with hunter-gatherer tribes like the Hadza in Africa.</p>\n\n<p>In my decade of study in this field, what I&#39;ve learned challenges the consensus of the diet and exercise industry. We&#39;ve always been told that exercise increases the number of calories we burn each day, but a <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0040503\">doubly labeled water study with the Hadza</a> conducted by me and my research team shows that our bodies have evolved to adjust to our daily level of physical activity, thereby adjusting our metabolism to keep daily energy expenditure within a narrow range, regardless of how active we are. Instead, the key to losing weight and battling the obesity pandemic is regulating the number of calories we consume versus how many we burn. That&#39;s not to say we should abandon exercise - it is essential to keeping our bodies healthy and to aging well - but diet is the tool we need to focus on to manage our weight.</p>\n\n<p>My new book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Burn-Research-Really-Calories-Healthy/dp/0525541527/\"><em>BURN</em></a>, examines this exciting research taking place outside of traditional labs and reveals how a new understanding of our metabolism can inform our efforts to promote a healthy and sustainable society.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re curious about why we can&#39;t &quot;earn&quot; that slice of chocolate cake, whether a Paleo diet is actually &quot;Paleo,&quot; <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/obr.12785\">what the Hadza can teach us about avoiding diseases of civilization like diabetes and obesity</a>, or what it&#39;s like to extract a live tick from your head while observing chimpanzees (true story), I am here for it. I am on at 3pm EST (20 UT), AMA!</p>\n\n<p>Username: <a href=\"/u/HermanPontzer\">/u/HermanPontzer</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/askscience/comments/lw0ef8/askscience_ama_series_im_herman_pontzer_an/","title":"AskScience AMA Series: I'm Herman Pontzer, an anthropologist and professor at Duke University.
