A large body of research has demonstrated a strong association between the gut microbiome and mental health. Microbes have been associated with neurological disorders ranging from degenerative diseases (such as Alzheimer&#39;s, Parkinson&#39;s, ALS and dementia) to mental health disorders (like depression and anxiety) that are becoming all-too-prevalent in today&#39;s society. However, there is still much that we don&#39;t understand about how these relationships are established or maintained.</p>\n\n<p>Join us today at 2 PM ET (19 UT) for a discussion with experts on what is being called the &quot;psychobiome&quot;, organized by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM). We&#39;ll discuss what we know about the relationships between microbes and hosts, how these relationships impact our behavior, moods and mental capacity, and what each of us can do to strengthen the health of our microbiomes, and, ultimately, improve our mental health.</p>\n\n<p>With us today are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://christyclutter.com/\">Dr. Christy Clutter, Ph.D.</a> (<a href=\"/u/DrClutter\">u/DrClutter</a>) - Contributing writer, American Society for Microbiology</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gibbons.isbscience.org/bio/sean-gibbons-phd/\">Dr. Sean Gibbons, Ph.D.</a> (<a href=\"/u/seangibbons\">u/seangibbons</a>) - Washington Research Foundation Distinguished Investigator &amp; Assistant Professor, Institute for Systems Biology</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hsiao.science/\">Dr. Jonathan Lynch, Ph.D.</a> (<a href=\"/u/micro_jon\">u/micro_jon</a>) - Postdoctoral Fellow, Hsiao Lab, UCLA</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bealab.bioe.uic.edu/\">Dr. Beatriz Peñalver Bernabé, Ph.D.</a> (<a href=\"/u/penalver\">u/penalver</a>) - Assistant Professor, Department of Bioengineering, University of Illinois Chicago</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lawsonresearch.ca/scientist/dr-gregor-reid\">Dr. Gregor Reid, Ph.D., MBA</a> (<a href=\"/u/Suspicious_Dinner_31\">u/Suspicious_Dinner_31</a>) - Endowed Chair in Human Microbiome and Probiotics, Lawson Health Research Institute</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Links:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://asm.org/Articles/2020/February/Of-Microbes-and-Mental-Health-Eating-for-Mental-We\">https://asm.org/Articles/2020/February/Of-Microbes-and-Mental-Health-Eating-for-Mental-We</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://msystems.asm.org/content/5/5/e00465-20\">https://msystems.asm.org/content/5/5/e00465-20</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6384226/\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6384226/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/05/meet-psychobiome-gut-bacteria-may-alter-how-you-think-feel-and-act\">https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/05/meet-psychobiome-gut-bacteria-may-alter-how-you-think-feel-and-act</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5641835/\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5641835/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-does-sars-cov-2-affect-the-brain\">https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-does-sars-cov-2-affect-the-brain</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/askscience/comments/m2qo23/askscience_ama_series_we_are_experts_looking_at/","title":"AskScience AMA Series: We are experts looking at connections between the gut microbiome and mental health.
