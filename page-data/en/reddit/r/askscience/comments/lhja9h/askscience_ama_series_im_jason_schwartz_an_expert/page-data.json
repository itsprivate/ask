We also <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/11/19/covid-19-vaccine-distribution-not-just-development-necessary-column/6333001002/\">wrote an op-ed</a> summarizing our findings and key messages.</p>\n\n<p>Ask me about how the vaccines have been tested and evaluated, what we know about them and what we&#39;re still learning, how guidelines for vaccine prioritization have been developed and implemented, how the U.S. federal government and state governments are working to administer vaccines quickly and equitably, and anything else about COVID vaccines and vaccination programs.</p>\n\n<p>More info about me <a href=\"https://medicine.yale.edu/lab/jschwartz/\">here</a>, and I&#39;m on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jasonlschwartz\">@jasonlschwartz</a>.
