I also leads our effort to administer 100 million vaccinations in the first 100 days. Before this, I was SVP and chief health officer at Kaiser Permanente and commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health before that.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m Carole Johnson and I&#39;m the national testing coordinator for the COVID-19 Response Team. I previously served as the Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Human Services, managing the state&#39;s largest agency including Medicaid, child care, food assistance, aging services, and mental health and substance use disorder treatment. For more than five years, I served in the Obama White House as senior health policy advisor and a member of the Domestic Policy Council health team working on Affordable Care Act implementation issues and public health challenges like Ebola and Zika. I also worked on Capitol Hill for members of three key health committees - Senate Finance, House Ways and Means, and Senate Aging - and in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&#39; Health Resources and Services Administration, the Alliance of Community Health Plans, the Pew Charitable Trusts, and the American Heart Association.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m Tim Manning and I&#39;m the national supply chain coordinator for the COVID-19 Response Team. I&#39;m an emergency manager, doing disaster and emergency response for the past 25 years; I&#39;ve worked at the local and state level, and served in FEMA for eight years as a Deputy Administrator. I&#39;ve been a firefighter and EMT, and I know first-hand the importance of having the equipment and supplies you need, when you need it on the front lines of a crisis. Right now, I work with teams across the government - from the Department of Defense to the Department of Health and Human Services - to ensure our country has the supplies we need, not just now but into the future too.</p>\n\n<p>We will be joining you all at 5 PM ET (22 UT), AUA!</p>\n\n<p>Username: <a href=\"/u/thewhitehouse\">/u/thewhitehouse</a>\nProof: To be posted (this is a verified AMA)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/askscience/comments/lfacyi/askscience_ama_series_we_are_bechara_choucair/","title":"AskScience AMA Series: We are Bechara Choucair, Carole Johnson, and Tim Manning, the vaccine, testing, and supply coordinators for the White House COVID-19 Response Team.
