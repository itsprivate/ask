Would stone or wooden flooring have been more common among the French, even for those who belonged to low-middle end of society?</p>\n\n<p>2) For what types of people would this practice of covering the floor with rushes been common? As he claims this applied to English houses &quot;in general&quot;, what kind of people would he have had to have visited to have been given this impression, and where would they land on the socio-economic spectrum?</p>\n\n<p>3) Finally, when did wooden flooring (or stone, but I assume wood would be more common) become the norm among farmers who were slightly more well to do? (Small landowning farmers, who would make a profit a good year and not live hand to mouth)</p>\n\n<p>/* End of questions */</p>\n\n<p>Just a message to the mods: you&#39;re doing such a good job.
