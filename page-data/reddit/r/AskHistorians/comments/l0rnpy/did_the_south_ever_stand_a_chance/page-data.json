I’m not sure how familiar the AskHistorians community is with the popular sentiments of the rural folk here concerning the Civil War, but it’s basically one long badhistory thread writ large and played out irl. </p>\n\n<p>I’ve heard it all, from the popular “states’ rights” argument to the more obscure and far-fetched (and quite obviously propaganda/misinformation-fueled) appeals to southern chivalry and defense against culture decay. </p>\n\n<p>The biggest disconnect I’ve encountered, both as a student and as a private citizen, is how either side of the aisle gives a different, sweeping statement regarding southern military power. White supremacists and victims of revisionist propaganda tend to suggest that the South was militarily superior but lost due to a myriad of innane excuses and vague references to “logistics.” At the same time, non-apologists suggest that victory was inevitable but merely delayed by surprise victories early on in the war.</p>\n\n<p>So, given that history very very rarely boils down to such reductionist explanations, what is the truth behind this? Did the South stand a chance? Did the North ever stand to lose?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Interestingly enough, I’ve received two contradictory answers that both sound plausible! The very phenomenon I just described has played out among historians here in a more thought-out manner.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/AskHistorians/comments/l0rnpy/did_the_south_ever_stand_a_chance/","title":"Did the South ever stand a chance?","tags":["AskHistorians","reddit"],"date":"January 19, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-19T22:17:54.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-19 22:17","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l0rnpy","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/l0rnpy/did_the_south_ever_stand_a_chance/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/l0rnpy/did_the_south_ever_stand_a_chance/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"AskHistorians","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians","author":"NerevarTheKing","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/NerevarTheKing","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"NerevarTheKing","score":146,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"南方有机会吗？","the_new_excerpt":"我住在美国南部。我不知道如何熟悉的\nAskHistorians社区与这里的农村民间的民情一样\n关于内战，但它基本上是一个长的坏历史线程写的\n大，并发挥出了IRL。\n\n我都听说了，从流行的 \"国家的... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"南方有機會嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"我住在美國南部。我不知道如何熟悉的\nAskHistorians社區與這裏的農村民間的民情一樣\n關於內戰，但它基本上是一個長的壞歷史線程寫的\n大，併發揮出了IRL。\n\n我都聽說了，從流行的 \"國家的... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lkplco","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/AskWomen/comments/lkplco/women_who_used_to_be_or_were_labeled_as_mean/","title":"Women who used to be or were labeled as “mean girls”, what was the turning point/event that made you realize you were being mean or being perceived as a mean person and want to change that?","date":"February 16, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"曾经或被贴上 \"刻薄女孩 \"标签的女性，是什么转折点/事件让你意识到自己的刻薄或被认为是一个刻薄的人，并想改变这种状况？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"曾經或被貼上 \"刻薄女孩 \"標籤的女性，是什麼轉折點/事件讓你意識到自己的刻薄或被認爲是一個刻薄的人，並想改變這種狀況？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lkwb78","excerpt":"I am 23 year old male who is in simple terms a loser in real life.
