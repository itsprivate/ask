We also learn that they brought in new materials and objects like books, horses, chariots and so in to India. This is what i know about it in brief. However, in a video I watched on Youtube, it seems to be that the Aryan invasion theory is actually fake. Apparently it was introduced by Europeans and the British Empire while India was under colonial rule, for reasons I can&#39;t exactly remember. I think it was along the lines of showing that the colonies had always been uncivilised and had to have some outsider ruling them. Would any historians like to present their point on this and prove/disprove the Aryan invasion theory, and also state why it ever came to be in the first place if it actually is fake?</p>\n\n<p>In the Youtube video, they have disproved the theory by using various techniques like genetics, linguistics, etc. I can&#39;t exactly remember which video it was, since I had watched it a while back, but I have provided a link of what i think is the video I saw.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VEdyPxkT3k\">Aryan Invasion Theory: Prove AIT, Win 2 Cr | David Frawley, Niraj Rai, Abhijit, Aravind, Sanjay - YouTube</a> </p>\n\n<p>Feel free to correct me as I don&#39;t have much knowledge on this topic or history in general.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/AskHistorians/comments/lv7y77/is_the_aryan_invasion_in_india_true/","title":"Is the Aryan invasion in India true?","tags":["AskHistorians","reddit"],"date":"March 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-01T15:39:21.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-01 15:39","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lv7y77","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/lv7y77/is_the_aryan_invasion_in_india_true/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/lv7y77/is_the_aryan_invasion_in_india_true/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"AskHistorians","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians","author":"Torpedo311","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Torpedo311","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Torpedo311","score":146,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"雅利安人入侵印度是真的吗？","the_new_excerpt":"在印度，当我们学习哈拉帕文明时，我们会被教导说\n雅利安文明的衰落是由雅利安人的入侵造成的，雅利安人是人类文明的始祖\n来自里海附近地区。我们还了解到，他们带来了新的\n材料和物品，如书、马、战车等在到... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"雅利安人入侵印度是真的嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"在印度，當我們學習哈拉帕文明時，我們會被教導說\n雅利安文明的衰落是由雅利安人的入侵造成的，雅利安人是人類文明的始祖\n來自裏海附近地區。我們還了解到，他們帶來了新的\n材料和物品，如書、馬、戰車等在到... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lv83s2","excerpt":"My logic is because the Qu'ran is still written in the same way it was\noriginally at around 700AD an Arabic speaker from today should be able to at\nleast have a limited conversation with someone from the past.","slug":"/reddit/r/AskHistorians/comments/lv83s2/would_an_arabic_speaker_from_today_be_able_to_at/","title":"Would an Arabic speaker from today be able to at least somewhat communicate with an Arabic speaker from around 1200 AD?","date":"March 01, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"今天的阿拉伯语人是否能够至少与公元1200年左右的阿拉伯语人进行某种程度的交流？","the_new_excerpt":"我的逻辑是，因为《古兰经》还是按照原来的方式写的。\n在公元700年左右的时候，今天的阿拉伯语人应该能够在...。\n至少和过去的人进行有限的对话。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"今天的阿拉伯語人是否能夠至少與公元1200年左右的阿拉伯語人進行某種程度的交流？","the_new_excerpt":"我的邏輯是，因爲《古蘭經》還是按照原來的方式寫的。\n在公元700年左右的時候，今天的阿拉伯語人應該能夠在...。\n至少和過去的人進行有限的對話。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lv5xz0","excerpt":"In college I learned that in order for nuclear fusion to start happening you\nneed the energy of your electrons to be high enough to overcome the Coulomb\npotential, so that they can interact with the nucleus of atoms.
