They were trick riders whose act was to ride motorcycles around a wooden motordrome affectionately known as the Wall of Death. One troupe even still uses the motordrome my great grandfather built. But the act is almost dead and carnivals today look very little like carnivals back then (i.e. dangerous acts, sideshows, &quot;geeks,&quot; etc.). I&#39;m curious what social and economic factors led to the decline of the traditional American carnival. Increased regulations? New competitors in the entertainment space? Changing cultural attitudes?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/AskHistorians/comments/l4gbrt/my_family_were_carnies_what_led_to_the_decline_of/","title":"My family were carnies.
