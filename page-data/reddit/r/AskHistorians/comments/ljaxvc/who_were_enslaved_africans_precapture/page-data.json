Were some part of larger West African society, in cities and such? What would often occur for these groups of Africans to end up captured and sold? Why would they have been conquered if they were tribal? Who would they have been really.</p>\n\n<p>I’d love to know anything about this part of history I feel isn’t really talked about much, or at least isn’t seen as important enough in comparison to what happened to their enslaved descendants, thanks to anyone who could help me understand 👍🏼</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/AskHistorians/comments/ljaxvc/who_were_enslaved_africans_precapture/","title":"Who were enslaved Africans pre-capture?","tags":["AskHistorians","reddit"],"date":"February 14, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-14T10:24:33.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-14 10:24","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ljaxvc","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ljaxvc/who_were_enslaved_africans_precapture/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ljaxvc/who_were_enslaved_africans_precapture/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"AskHistorians","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians","author":"4d61780d","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/4d61780d","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"4d61780d","score":102,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"被俘前的非洲奴隶是谁？","the_new_excerpt":"你好，我最近一直在研究组成我的国家的历史。\nDNA，并意识到我已经在我的 曾经听说过我的西非祖先的历史，\n从他们到达加勒比海到现在，我觉得我需要看的东西\n成，不相信这对他们的遗产是公平的集中... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"被俘前的非洲奴隸是誰？","the_new_excerpt":"你好，我最近一直在研究組成我的國家的歷史。\nDNA，並意識到我已經在我的 曾經聽說過我的西非祖先的歷史，\n從他們到達加勒比海到現在，我覺得我需要看的東西\n成，不相信這對他們的遺產是公平的集中... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m5vlem","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/m5vlem/if_you_spread_chewed_gum_across_your_butthole_and/","title":"If you spread chewed gum across your butthole and farted, could you blow a bubble with your butt?","date":"March 16, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"如果你把嚼过的口香糖铺在屁眼上放屁，你能用屁股吹出一个泡泡吗？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"如果你把嚼過的口香糖鋪在屁眼上放屁，你能用屁股吹出一個泡泡嗎？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m5xajk","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/m5xajk/can_i_relocate_a_spider_to_a_part_of_my_house/","title":"Can I “relocate” a spider to a part of my house with more bug traffic?
