He believed that only a king who ruled by himself without giving any concessions to a parliament was adequate. </p>\n\n<p>However, his entire life seemed to be in opposition to that. </p>\n\n<p>He had no ties to the royal family, and was low enough nobility that the crown’s limited power would be of no concern to him. And throughout all his life, the royals would do nothing but fuck up his plans. Being sent off to Russia, having to scream at the King so he would understand the right political moves, and then finally being dismissed by Wilhelm and replaced.</p>\n\n<p>I would understand if he had some weird patriotic idea that was inherently tied with the monarchy during his younger years, but he mantained the same position all his life on this, while his entire political career was basically the universe screaming “LOOK, YOU SHOULDNT PUT SO MUCH POWER ON SOMEONE THAT COULD BE INCOMPETENT” on his face.</p>\n\n<p>So why exactly did he support absolutism? What was going throughout his mind to keep justifying this system that did nothing but screw him over and show its incompetency throughout his political career? Did he genuinely believe that the monarch was chosen by God and he would go to hell if he disobeyed?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/AskHistorians/comments/m32rh2/why_was_bismarck_an_absolutist/","title":"Why Was Bismarck An Absolutist?","tags":["AskHistorians","reddit"],"date":"March 12, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-12T08:52:54.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-12 08:52","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m32rh2","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/m32rh2/why_was_bismarck_an_absolutist/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/m32rh2/why_was_bismarck_an_absolutist/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"AskHistorians","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians","author":"Orcus_The_Fatty","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Orcus_The_Fatty","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Orcus_The_Fatty","score":102,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"俾斯麦为什么是个绝对主义者？","the_new_excerpt":"如果你读了关于俾斯麦的文章，你首先会了解到的是，他\n他对民主和议会的概念进行了激烈的批评。他认为\n一朝天子一朝臣\n是足够的。\n\n然而，他的一生似乎在... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"俾斯麥爲什麼是個絕對主義者？","the_new_excerpt":"如果你讀了關於俾斯麥的文章，你首先會了解到的是，他\n他對民主和議會的概念進行了激烈的批評。他認爲\n一朝天子一朝臣\n是足夠的。\n\n然而，他的一生似乎在... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m37ly4","excerpt":"His whole life my younger brother has always been blind.
