One example might be that they used the Phalanx formation in the siege of Rome (maybe, I read it somewhere but I&#39;m not sure). Implementing these types of ancient battle tactics or bringing back those units must have given the enemies a great surprise. An arab or Turkic or Slavic army would never expect to meet a legion in battle, which could work in the Byzantines&#39; advantage, couldn&#39;t it?</p>\n\n<p>Also do we see similar revival in the fields of literature and arts?
