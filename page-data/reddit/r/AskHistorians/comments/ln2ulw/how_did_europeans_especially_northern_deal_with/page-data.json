As someone, of European descent who lives in a continental climate, who sweats really easy, this is always my first thought. I can’t imagine any European colonizer, whether it be in Mexico, the Caribbean, Brazil, or wherever, as anything but just sweating themselves into a puddle all the time, and just how gross they must have been, especially with all the clothes and armor. Was it something they just ‘toughed’ out, or did they actually have some way of dealing with it?</p>\n\n<p>Sorry if this is a really broad question, but I can’t find a better way to put it.
