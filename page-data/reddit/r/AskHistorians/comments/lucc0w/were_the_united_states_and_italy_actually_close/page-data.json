After the 11 Italian-Americans were lynched relations between the U.S. and Italy got much worse, with the nations withdrawing their ambassadors. After Italian demands to arrest the lynchers were refused, some sources say that Italy even considered going to war with the U.S. This wasn&#39;t described in much detail, and the couple sources I found online mentioned that the President placated Italy by paying reparations and declaring a &quot;Columbus Day&quot; holiday in 1892, and the tensions eased.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially: Was war ever actually considered as an option to respond to the incident, or is it just exaggerated rumors? If it was actually considered, did each side actually have a war plan for a U.S.-Italian War, or would the two sides have just sat on opposite sides of the Atlantic until making peace?</p>\n\n<p>Sources making the claim of war fears or a &quot;war scare&quot;: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_14,_1891_New_Orleans_lynchings#Political_repercussions\">The Wikipedia article on the incident</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.peterlang.com/view/title/55205%5D(A%20summary%20of%20a%20book%20I%20cannot%20find%20online\">A summary of a book I cannot find online</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://law.jrank.org/pages/2694/New-Orleans-Mafia-Trial-1891-First-Best-Even-Most-Law-Abiding.html\">Another article</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/AskHistorians/comments/lucc0w/were_the_united_states_and_italy_actually_close/","title":"Were the United States and Italy actually close to war in 1891 after the New Orleans Lynching Incident?","tags":["AskHistorians","reddit"],"date":"March 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-01T05:54:57.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-01 05:54","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lucc0w","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/lucc0w/were_the_united_states_and_italy_actually_close/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/lucc0w/were_the_united_states_and_italy_actually_close/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"AskHistorians","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians","author":"TheManWithTheBigName","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheManWithTheBigName","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"TheManWithTheBigName","score":103,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"1891年新奥尔良私刑事件后，美国和意大利是否真的接近战争？","the_new_excerpt":"详述一下。我在读1891年新奥尔良的大规模私刑。在\n11名意大利裔美国人被处以私刑 美国和意大利之间的关系得到了改善。\n糟糕得多，各国纷纷撤回大使。在意大利\n逮捕私刑犯的要求被拒绝，一些消息来源说... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"1891年新奧爾良私刑事件後，美國和意大利是否真的接近戰爭？","the_new_excerpt":"詳述一下。我在讀1891年新奧爾良的大規模私刑。在\n11名意大利裔美國人被處以私刑 美國和意大利之間的關係得到了改善。\n糟糕得多，各國紛紛撤回大使。在意大利\n逮捕私刑犯的要求被拒絕，一些消息來源說... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-luf3db","excerpt":"Military Junta staged coup on Feb1 and now shooting protesters on the streets.\nSoldiers and polices are using guns, snipers, rifles, tear gas, stun grenade in\naddition to looting, beating, extortion against peaceful protesters with\nCOMPLETE IMPUNITY. as I am writing, a women got shot in the head in…","slug":"/reddit/r/Ask_Politics/comments/luf3db/how_probable_is_un_to_invoke_responsibility_to/","title":"How probable is UN to invoke Responsibility to Protect in Myanmar against genocidal Regime?","date":"March 01, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"联合国在缅甸援引 \"保护责任 \"反对种族灭绝政权的可能性有多大？","the_new_excerpt":"军政府在2月1日发动政变，现在在街上向示威者开枪。\n士兵和警察正在使用枪支，狙击手，步枪，催泪瓦斯，眩晕手榴弹在。\n除了抢劫、殴打、勒索和平抗议者外，还对他们进行了以下活动：\n我在写这篇文章的时候，有一个女人头部中枪... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"聯合國在緬甸援引 \"保護責任 \"反對種族滅絕政權的可能性有多大？","the_new_excerpt":"軍政府在2月1日發動政變，現在在街上向示威者開槍。\n士兵和警察正在使用槍支，狙擊手，步槍，催淚瓦斯，眩暈手榴彈在。\n除了搶劫、毆打、勒索和平抗議者外，還對他們進行了以下活動：\n我在寫這篇文章的時候，有一個女人頭部中槍... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-luil0d","excerpt":"I don't know when or how this started but it seems like nowadays you can't judge\nsomeone for their porn/sexual preferences, even if they are crazy screwed up.
