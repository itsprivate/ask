Everything from early 20th century analytic philosophers to the modern day caricatures that exist (sometimes exclusively) in the minds of those who frequent the dark web.</p>\n\n<p>Why is this? I can understand commitments to left wing views on politicized topics such as climate science or evolution, or other social issues. But why is capitalism so widely despised, particularly among ethicists, who otherwise seem capable of enough radical skepticism to seriously entertain the thought that anything could be moral or immoral? How can we KNOW with enough certainty that a political idea is worth spending effort on?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: If anyone would like to seriously discuss or dismantle my responses rather than trade downvotes, my DMs are open. So far, this post has reinforced a lot of what I already believe, but I don&#39;t want to de-rail from the question.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/askphilosophy/comments/m4xsqv/why_do_philosophers_primarily_lean_to_the_left/","title":"Why do philosophers primarily lean to the left politically?","tags":["askphilosophy","reddit"],"date":"March 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-15T04:08:09.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-15 04:08","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m4xsqv","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/m4xsqv/why_do_philosophers_primarily_lean_to_the_left/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/m4xsqv/why_do_philosophers_primarily_lean_to_the_left/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"askphilosophy","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy","author":"Southern_Winter","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Southern_Winter","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Southern_Winter","score":103,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"为什么哲学家在政治上主要倾向于左派？","the_new_excerpt":"我注意到，几乎所有理论派别的哲学家和\n所有的时期都有一些相当亲人文主义或民粹主义的价值观。\n从20世纪初的分析哲学家到现代的... ...\n漫画，存在于那些人的头脑中（有时是唯一的）。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼哲學家在政治上主要傾向於左派？","the_new_excerpt":"我注意到，幾乎所有理論派別的哲學家和\n所有的時期都有一些相當親人文主義或民粹主義的價值觀。\n從20世紀初的分析哲學家到現代的... ...\n漫畫，存在於那些人的頭腦中（有時是唯一的）。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m52rks","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/AskReddit/comments/m52rks/what_popular_rumour_in_your_school_turned_out_to/","title":"What popular rumour in your school turned out to be true?","date":"March 15, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"你们学校流行的什么传言原来是真的？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"你們學校流行的什麼傳言原來是真的？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m4zj9e","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/AskReddit/comments/m4zj9e/what_was_the_best_phrase_you_found_written_on/","title":"What was the best phrase you found written on public restroom walls?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 15, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"你发现公共厕所墙壁上写的最好的一句话是什么？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"你發現公共廁所牆壁上寫的最好的一句話是什麼？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-m4xsqv","previousId":"RedditPost-m52rks","nextId":"RedditPost-m4zj9e","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/askphilosophy/comments/m4xsqv/why_do_philosophers_primarily_lean_to_the_left/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
