The drug becomes the brains top priority. So why would your subconscious decide to stop using what your neural pathways rely on for pleasure? You could argue that your brain recognizes the harm done to your body, but what about a gambling or sex addiction that has no adverse effect on the body and is purely mental? Why would your subconscious choose to randomly quit? Wouldn’t the person who chooses to go against his brain function have free will?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I know I am most likely wrong and want free will to exist to appease my mind, but the discussion has been very interesting. I love reading everyone’s viewpoints. Thanks for the discussion!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/askphilosophy/comments/l349dv/does_beating_addiction_give_evidence_of_free_will/","title":"Does beating addiction give evidence of free will?","tags":["askphilosophy","reddit"],"date":"January 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-23T20:17:36.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-23 20:17","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l349dv","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/l349dv/does_beating_addiction_give_evidence_of_free_will/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/l349dv/does_beating_addiction_give_evidence_of_free_will/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"askphilosophy","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy","author":"Over_Point_9646","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Over_Point_9646","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Over_Point_9646","score":166,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"殴打成瘾是否能提供自由意志的证据？","the_new_excerpt":"吸毒者的大脑已经被重新连接，从他们的药物中接收多巴胺。\n取，而不是自然方法。药物成为大脑的首要任务。所以\n为什么你的潜意识会决定停止使用你的神经通路所依赖的东西？\n为了快乐？你可以说，你的大脑识别... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"毆打成癮是否能提供自由意志的證據？","the_new_excerpt":"吸毒者的大腦已經被重新連接，從他們的藥物中接收多巴胺。\n取，而不是自然方法。藥物成爲大腦的首要任務。所以\n爲什麼你的潛意識會決定停止使用你的神經通路所依賴的東西？\n爲了快樂？你可以說，你的大腦識別... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-loakw2","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/AskWomen/comments/loakw2/what_are_signs_of_healthy_vs_unhealthy_boundaries/","title":"What are signs of healthy vs unhealthy boundaries?","date":"February 21, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"健康与不健康的界限有哪些迹象？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"健康與不健康的界限有哪些跡象？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lok8uf","excerpt":"Just being alone and working outside etc, was great.
