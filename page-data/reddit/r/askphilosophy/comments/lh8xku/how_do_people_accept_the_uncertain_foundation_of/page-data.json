I&#39;m not saying that this is necessarily wrong, but how do moral philosophers develop theories on this when, in many philosopher&#39;s opinions, morals are simply constructs to help the human race thrive? How do people bring themselves to care about moral philosophy if they don&#39;t believe it&#39;s universal? Is it to keep order? But that&#39;s what law is for(I think that morals are for human survival and law, for order). I understand that some moral philosophers may be fuelled by religious morals, so I ask all moral philosophers who think that morals are a survival construct. Maybe I just don&#39;t get it, but I&#39;d like to hear from some people interested in moral philosophy to help myself understand your point of view. I thank all respondents in advance and wish everyone a pleasant day.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/askphilosophy/comments/lh8xku/how_do_people_accept_the_uncertain_foundation_of/","title":"How Do People Accept the Uncertain Foundation of Moral Philosophy?","tags":["askphilosophy","reddit"],"date":"February 11, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-11T13:23:32.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-11 13:23","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lh8xku","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/lh8xku/how_do_people_accept_the_uncertain_foundation_of/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/lh8xku/how_do_people_accept_the_uncertain_foundation_of/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"askphilosophy","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy","author":"xXTeaCultureXx","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/xXTeaCultureXx","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"xXTeaCultureXx","score":102,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"人们如何接受道德哲学的不确定基础？","the_new_excerpt":"在道德哲学中，我看到很多假设，谋杀=坏事，帮助=好事。\n死亡=坏事，以此类推。我不是说这样做一定是错的，但怎么会有\n道德哲学家对此发展理论时，在许多哲学家的\n观点，道德只是帮助人类发展的构造？","locale":"zh"},{"title":"人們如何接受道德哲學的不確定基礎？","the_new_excerpt":"在道德哲學中，我看到很多假設，謀殺=壞事，幫助=好事。\n死亡=壞事，以此類推。我不是說這樣做一定是錯的，但怎麼會有\n道德哲學家對此發展理論時，在許多哲學家的\n觀點，道德只是幫助人類發展的構造？","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m38d7w","excerpt":"As noted, what is the history of the filibuster?
