I am thirty now and most of my life I have tried to just lay low. But I have been having constantly evolving and persistently deep philosophical thoughts about everything I do. It effects most of my every day behavior. I think it&#39;s been a very good thing for me but I find myself wanting to engage others in discussions of these ideas I have, but I can see that people are uninterested. I actually feel that I am more aware than I have ever been of my own habits and more understanding of others because of this. I am just having a real hard time expressing and exploring these new tendencies. Pleas let me know if you have had anything like this or have recommendations for me!</p>\n\n<p>Not sure if this is the right place but I have been looking all over.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: wow I didn&#39;t think I would get many replies. If anyone wants to have more discussions I would love to. Maybe even a group would be cool. Message me if you are interested. This thread has been very stimulating already and I think you all have something to offer!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/lxdtzr/have_any_of_you_gone_through_a_major_change_of/","title":"Have any of you gone through a major change of personality that makes it hard for you to relate to others?","tags":["TrueAskReddit","reddit"],"date":"March 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-04T17:15:04.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-04 17:15","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lxdtzr","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/lxdtzr/have_any_of_you_gone_through_a_major_change_of/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/lxdtzr/have_any_of_you_gone_through_a_major_change_of/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"TrueAskReddit","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit","author":"eymerin","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/eymerin","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"eymerin","score":102,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"你们有谁经历了性格上的重大变化，让你很难与他人相处？","the_new_excerpt":"我从来都不是一个有强烈意见的人。我现在三十岁了，我的大部分\n生活中，我一直试图只是低调。但我一直有不断演变的\n并对我所做的每一件事都坚持不懈地进行深刻的哲学思考。它影响着\n我每天的大部分行为。我认为这是一个非常好的... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你們有誰經歷了性格上的重大變化，讓你很難與他人相處？","the_new_excerpt":"我從來都不是一個有強烈意見的人。我現在三十歲了，我的大部分\n生活中，我一直試圖只是低調。但我一直有不斷演變的\n並對我所做的每一件事都堅持不懈地進行深刻的哲學思考。它影響着\n我每天的大部分行爲。我認爲這是一個非常好的... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lxlp1c","excerpt":"Another question, does it effect vertical writing like Chinese differently?","slug":"/reddit/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/lxlp1c/how_does_dyslexia_affect_people_using_non_western/","title":"How does dyslexia affect people using non western characters?
