I know many people might actually jump forward calling me &quot;snowflake&quot;, but I&#39;ll show you what I mean with some clear examples, comparing an actual scene with a gender reverse scene that almost never happens.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Diary of a wimpy kid&quot; (boy aged 10 to 13)<br/>\n<strong>SCENE 1 from &quot;Rodrick Rules&quot; -</strong><br/>\nORIGINAL: A teen boy steals his younger brother&#39;s journal and runs away. The young boy chases him, wearing only his underwear and he ends up in the main hall of the hotel, surrounded by several adults. Meanwhile, a camera is recording everything. Hiding behind a vase, the boy manages to get his diary and keeps running half-naked around the hotel, then where the swimming pool is and finally he ends up in a restroom, only to find out that it&#39;s an old ladies&#39; restroom. The old ladies become aware of the intruder and try to grab him. Somehow, he manages to escape.<br/>\nFunny, huh? Now let&#39;s reverse it.<br/>\nREVERSE: A teen girl steals her younger sister&#39;s journal and runs away. The young girl chases her, wearing only her underwear/bra and she ends up in the main hall of the hotel, surrounded by several adults. Meanwhile, a camera is recording everything. Hiding behind a vase, the girl manages to get her diary and keeps running half-naked around the hotel, then where the swimming pool is and finally she ends up in a restroom, only to find out that it&#39;s an old men&#39;s restroom. The old men become aware of the intruder and try to grab her. Somehow, she manages to escape.</p>\n\n<p><strong>SCENE 2 from &quot;Dog Days&quot; -</strong><br/>\nORIGINAL: The boy dives into the swimming pool, but his swimsuit remains stuck on the diving platform. A girl picks it up and intentionally throws it away, so that the boy remains naked in the pool. He spends several hours in the water, trying to avoid all approaching girls, until the pool closes and he asks a lifeguard to hand him a definitely small girl swimsuit that&#39;s lying close to him.<br/>\nFunny, huh? Now let&#39;s reverse it.<br/>\nREVERSE: The girl dives into the swimming pool, but her swimsuit remains stuck on the diving platform. A boy picks it up and intentionally throws it away, so that the girl remains naked in the pool. She spends several hours in the water, trying to avoid all approaching boys, until the pool closes and she asks a lifeguard to hand her a definitely small speedo that&#39;s lying close to him. </p>\n\n<p>Some more things that are apparently acceptable in movies/TV series are:<br/>\n- pantsing a boy [there&#39;s even a cut scene from &quot;Home alone&quot;]<br/>\n- hitting a boy [like the punch after a stolen kiss in &quot;Young Sheldon&quot;]<br/>\n- hitting a boy in the crotch [&quot;Little Manhattan&quot;]<br/>\n- making rape jokes about boys [&quot;Keeper&#39;n til Liverpool&quot;, there&#39;s literally a prison rape joke]<br/>\n- adult women kissing boys [&quot;Blank Check&quot;, a boy and a woman kiss on the mouth romantically]<br/>\n- talking about a boy&#39;s sexual urges [again, this is a recurring trope in &quot;Young Sheldon&quot;]<br/>\n- actually showing sexual acts performed from/on boys [I won&#39;t list films for obvious reasons]  </p>\n\n<p>I mean, how many films/TV series do you know displaying similar scenes but with girls? Almost none. I&#39;ve seen an uproar against &quot;Cuties&quot;, but that kind of content is sort of a standard trope if boys are targeted. Why is nobody doing anything to stop this?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/ljs05s/why_is_child_abuse_on_boys_played_for_laughs_in/","title":"Why is child abuse on boys played for laughs in so many movies & TV series?
