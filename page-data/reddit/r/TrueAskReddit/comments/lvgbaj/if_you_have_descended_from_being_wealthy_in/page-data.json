It’s like my whole world view and sense of self has been forced to adjust rapidly and it’s been more than I can take. Plus, my family looks down on me. I see a therapist but she doesn’t really get it and if I tell others about this they think I’m being a snob or something but it’s a huge shock to go from complete security and endless possibilities to the opposite. Can anyone share their stories? It would mean the world to me.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/lvgbaj/if_you_have_descended_from_being_wealthy_in/","title":"If you have descended from being wealthy in family of origin to a lower socioeconomic status in adulthood, how have you coped?","tags":["TrueAskReddit","reddit"],"date":"March 01, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-01T23:46:01.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-01 23:46","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lvgbaj","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/lvgbaj/if_you_have_descended_from_being_wealthy_in/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/lvgbaj/if_you_have_descended_from_being_wealthy_in/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"TrueAskReddit","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit","author":"Reasonable_Praline85","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Reasonable_Praline85","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Reasonable_Praline85","score":105,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"如果你从原生家庭的富裕降到成年后的社会经济地位较低，你是如何应对的？","the_new_excerpt":"我生长在一个富裕的家庭，成年后发现自己的收入较低。\n由于一连串的意外情况，我已经能够改善的事情。\n但我从来没有真正得到过去发生的事情。我发现它非常\n难以适应，认为自己几乎受到了创伤... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"如果你從原生家庭的富裕降到成年後的社會經濟地位較低，你是如何應對的？","the_new_excerpt":"我生長在一個富裕的家庭，成年後發現自己的收入較低。\n由於一連串的意外情況，我已經能夠改善的事情。\n但我從來沒有真正得到過去發生的事情。我發現它非常\n難以適應，認爲自己幾乎受到了創傷... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lvgm9t","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/lvgm9t/to_nonamericans_do_yall_have_that_was_it_a/","title":"To non-americans, do y’all have that “was it a gunshot, or fire cracker. cause ones illegal and it isn’t the gun.” moment after hearing a loud bang in the middle of the night?","date":"March 01, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"对非美国人来说，你们在半夜听到一声巨响后，会不会有那种 \"是枪声，还是鞭炮，因为那是非法的，不是枪 \"的感觉？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"對非美國人來說，你們在半夜聽到一聲巨響後，會不會有那種 \"是槍聲，還是鞭炮，因爲那是非法的，不是槍 \"的感覺？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lv6q6j","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/AskReddit/comments/lv6q6j/what_are_some_movies_that_are_so_fucking_goodthat/","title":"What are some movies that are so fucking good,that not many people know about?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 02, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"有哪些电影这么好，却没有多少人知道？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"有哪些電影這麼好，卻沒有多少人知道？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-lvgbaj","previousId":"RedditPost-lvgm9t","nextId":"RedditPost-lv6q6j","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/lvgbaj/if_you_have_descended_from_being_wealthy_in/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
