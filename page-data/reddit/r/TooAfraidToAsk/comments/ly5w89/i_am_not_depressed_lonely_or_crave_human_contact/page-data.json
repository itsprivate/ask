Since 16, I have isolated myself in my own room watching TV, video games, maladaptive Daydreaming and eating.</p>\n\n<p>I genuinely love isolating myself and love to eat alone. I love being abandoned and always find it bizarre when I see people cry for being lonely.</p>\n\n<p>Why people cry or feel sad for being lonely? Why people crave human attention? Why people want new friends? Why people want to date, have a family and be successful or rich?</p>\n\n<p>MY GOAL IN LIFE\nMy goal in life isn&#39;t to be rich, successful or have a career. I just want a one room apartment, a normal job, eat and die alone. </p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t want to get married, live with a family or have friends.</p>\n\n<p>FAMILY nd FRIENDS\nI don&#39;t need anyone to love me or crave their attention. Even on my birthday, I don&#39;t celebrate it and just love to eat alone. I never made a friend, since 2014. </p>\n\n<p>I avoid my school friends, when they call. I never felt lonely or depressed because of being alone. </p>\n\n<p>SEX LIFE\nI don&#39;t crave romantic partner or even have the personality or desire to have a girlfriend. </p>\n\n<p>I have been Daydreaming, since childhood. I create my own porn in my head and masturbate.\nFor me, &quot;masturbation is much better, than sex&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>So I don&#39;t need any partner. </p>\n\n<p>HUMAN CONTACT\nI engage in maladaptive Daydreaming and create characters in my head just to maintain my social skills.</p>\n\n<p>I have a girlfriend, mother, father and own a company. I talk to them and play their roles.</p>\n\n<p>It helped me in real life, to atleast communicate or survive by communication.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/ly5w89/i_am_not_depressed_lonely_or_crave_human_contact/","title":"I am not depressed, lonely or crave human contact.
