I’ve also seen these two terms used in friendships when one of the friends is venting about the other to someone else. Someone venting to a third party about you doesn’t automatically mean that they’re fake or toxic. If they’re spreading lies and just talking shit about you, that’s completely different. However, if you’re doing something problematic, them venting to a third party about it doesn’t make them toxic or fake. Should they talk to you about it and try to solve the problem? Absolutely, but I think my point still stands. </p>\n\n<p>I feel like these words are used so vaguely and loosely as well. It’s like...ok...? How exactly were they toxic? “Fake” in what way? </p>\n\n<p>I’ve even seen and met countless people using these terms hypocritically and/or when they’re just psychologically projecting. They’ll be backstabbing and shit-talking people fucking constantly, and then once other people start doing the same to them, they’re all of a sudden upset and they’re “so done with fake/toxic people.” Like...come on lmao. Give me a fucking break. Similar to what I said at the beginning of this paragraph, a lot of the time, the other person/people they’re referring to isn’t/aren’t even toxic or fake. THEY are the toxic ones, THEY are the fake ones. Anyway, I think you get what I’m saying.</p>\n\n<p>Idk tho, does anyone else feel this way?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/kyl30k/does_anyone_else_feel_like_the_terms_fake_and/","title":"Does anyone else feel like the terms “fake” and “toxic” are overused?","tags":["TooAfraidToAsk","reddit"],"date":"January 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-16T20:57:58.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-16 20:57","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"kyl30k","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/kyl30k/does_anyone_else_feel_like_the_terms_fake_and/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/kyl30k/does_anyone_else_feel_like_the_terms_fake_and/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"TooAfraidToAsk","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk","author":"xx5uff3rxx","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/xx5uff3rxx","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"xx5uff3rxx","score":142,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"还有人觉得 \"假 \"和 \"毒 \"这两个词用得太多了吗？","the_new_excerpt":"我见过很多人形容一个人是假的或有毒的，但说实话，它\n貌合神离而已(两情相悦)\n和友谊）。) 我也见过这两个词用在友谊中，当其中一个人的\n朋友是在向别人发泄对方....。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"還有人覺得 \"假 \"和 \"毒 \"這兩個詞用得太多了嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"我見過很多人形容一個人是假的或有毒的，但說實話，它\n貌合神離而已(兩情相悅)\n和友誼）。) 我也見過這兩個詞用在友誼中，當其中一個人的\n朋友是在向別人發泄對方....。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-liau4s","excerpt":"I've seen a lot of posts talking about lots of people dying (like plane crashes\nto name one) and in every one of this posts there is someone saying \"rip angels\"\nor smt like that; the same thing can be said about celebrities.
