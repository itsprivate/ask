Her family&#39;s money is old. It comes from the heyday of NYC advertising. She and her siblings attended separate private boarding schools growing up, and they pay for everything with their own cards attached to their parent&#39;s accounts. Their private college is paid for in full as well.</p>\n\n<p>I myself am from a working class background. I grew up in rural Pennsylvania and I am the first and only person so far in my family to attend college. I grew up living in trailer courts and eventually, a modest 3 bd 1 bath house. </p>\n\n<p>My gf and I have been together for about 4 months, and she has been consistently tight-lipped (as most wealthy people are) regarding her family&#39;s lifestyle and exactly how much money they have. But I&#39;m very observant and it doesn&#39;t take a rocket scientist to figure out when someone is heavily privileged compared to yourself.</p>\n\n<p>This weekend, I had the pleasure of traveling with my gf to Connecticut to meet her parents for the first time. Let me just say: Holy shit. I was right. </p>\n\n<p>Her family is clearly wealthy. I mean, they don&#39;t own private jets or anything, but the house is a massive 6 bedroom, 6 bathroom place located on a huge piece of property with an incredibly nice courtyard, pool area, etc.</p>\n\n<p>In the weeks leading up to this visit, I was a nervous wreck about how a poor kid like me might come off to them. They aren&#39;t snobby people or anything, but I was really nervouse because of the class difference, and I vaguely told my gf this a few times before we went up.</p>\n\n<p>When we got there, I must&#39;ve looked like a deer in the headlights. The place was easily the most gorgeous home I&#39;ve ever been in. I was blown away.</p>\n\n<p>Shortly after we arrived and we had a minute to ourselves, my gf came up to me, gave me a kiss and a hug and said, sincere as could be:</p>\n\n<p>&quot;See? I told you were worried for nothing. My family isn&#39;t even rich, as you can clearly see.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>So my question is....how and why are rich people so out of touch about how rich they really are???</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/m6ei7t/why_dont_rich_people_know_theyre_rich/","title":"Why don't rich people know they're rich?","tags":["TooAfraidToAsk","reddit"],"date":"March 16, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-16T23:54:37.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-16 23:54","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m6ei7t","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/m6ei7t/why_dont_rich_people_know_theyre_rich/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/m6ei7t/why_dont_rich_people_know_theyre_rich/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"TooAfraidToAsk","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk","author":"enigmazweb24","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/enigmazweb24","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"enigmazweb24","score":101,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"为什么有钱人不知道自己是有钱人？","the_new_excerpt":"最近我一直在想这个问题 因为我最近开始和一个女孩约会了\n其家庭明显富裕（至少从我的角度来看）。\n\n她在康涅狄格州的郊区长大。她家的钱是旧的。它来自于\n纽约市广告业的鼎盛时期。她和她的兄弟姐妹分别参加了... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼有錢人不知道自己是有錢人？","the_new_excerpt":"最近我一直在想這個問題 因爲我最近開始和一個女孩約會了\n其家庭明顯富裕（至少從我的角度來看）。\n\n她在康涅狄格州的郊區長大。她家的錢是舊的。它來自於\n紐約市廣告業的鼎盛時期。她和她的兄弟姐妹分別參加了... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m6grxj","excerpt":"\"i know my art sucks, but figured i’d share anyways\"\n\n\"this’ll probably die in new, but here’s this meme i made\"\n\nand like 85% of the time it’s followed by something that looks better than\nanything i could create with my time. why do people reward this behavior?\nwhether or not OP is conscious of it,…","slug":"/reddit/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/m6grxj/why_does_anyone_upvote_those_posts_with/","title":"Why does anyone upvote those posts with self-deprecating titles?","date":"March 16, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"为什么会有人给那些标题自嘲的帖子加票？","the_new_excerpt":"\"我知道我的艺术很烂，但我想我会分享任何方式\"\n\n\"这可能会死在新的，但这里的这个备忘录我做\"\n\n和像85％的时间，它的后面的东西，看起来比更好的\n我可以用我的时间创造任何东西 为什么人们要奖励这种行为？\n不管OP是否有意识到这一点，...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼會有人給那些標題自嘲的帖子加票？","the_new_excerpt":"\"我知道我的藝術很爛，但我想我會分享任何方式\"\n\n\"這可能會死在新的，但這裏的這個備忘錄我做\"\n\n和像85％的時間，它的後面的東西，看起來比更好的\n我可以用我的時間創造任何東西 爲什麼人們要獎勵這種行爲？\n不管OP是否有意識到這一點，...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-m69z3o","excerpt":"I've recently learned that many fruits and vegetables looked nothing like what\nthey do today, before we started growing them.
