We are hopeful this won&#39;t catch too many other types of questions but understand that sexuality questions can sometimes get caught in our filter so don&#39;t hesitate to message us if you believe your question has nothing to do with trans/NB/pronoun stuff and we will review it for approval. </p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re here to ask a trans question, you really should try using our search bar. The recent influx of trans questions to the sub means that not only has your question likely already been answered but it also means you&#39;ll get to skip out on all the additional harassment from users who either refuse to give you the benefit of the doubt or are here to act in bad faith.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/m589f3/temporary_restrictions_around_transrelated/","title":"Temporary restrictions around trans-related questions due to how repetitive it's getting.","tags":["TooAfraidToAsk","reddit"],"date":"March 15, 2021","dateISO":"2021-03-15T08:50:27.000Z","datetime":"2021-03-15 08:50","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"m589f3","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/m589f3/temporary_restrictions_around_transrelated/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/m589f3/temporary_restrictions_around_transrelated/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"TooAfraidToAsk","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk","author":"Hospitalities","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Hospitalities","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"Hospitalities","score":103,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"围绕跨相关问题的临时限制，因为它的重复性越来越高。","the_new_excerpt":"嗨，我的天\n\n小贴子，只是想告诉你，我们已经决定暂时暂停了\n由于所有人的答复都很尖刻，因此，与跨性别问题有关的问题也很难得到解决。\n双方对这个问题的看法以及它的重复性。我们希望这不会\n其他类型的问题太多，但明白... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"圍繞跨相關問題的臨時限制，因爲它的重複性越來越高。","the_new_excerpt":"嗨，我的天\n\n小貼子，只是想告訴你，我們已經決定暫時暫停了\n由於所有人的答覆都很尖刻，因此，與跨性別問題有關的問題也很難得到解決。\n雙方對這個問題的看法以及它的重複性。我們希望這不會\n其他類型的問題太多，但明白... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m4zgo7","excerpt":"I understand the “American Dream” was once a highly valued and sought after\nthing, but now?
