About half of the ads I receive are for obvious scams which I highly suspect are illegal. </p>\n\n<p>How can YouTube present itself as a family friendly platform while allowing criminals and fraudsters to advertise on their platform? Where do they draw the line? Would they take down an ad for heroin? An ad which gave you a virus when you clicked on it? Why is nobody cracking down on this? YouTube is facilitating illegal scams, which is almost certainly causing children and naive adults to lose money, as well as causing annoyance and making their platform look trashy. It didn’t used to be like this ten years ago, you would get normal ads for normal products, and I don’t understand (a) how the current situation arose or (b) why US and EU regulators don’t seem to care.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/lsxgo9/why_does_youtube_allow_blatant_scams_to_advertise/","title":"Why does YouTube allow blatant scams to advertise on their platform?
