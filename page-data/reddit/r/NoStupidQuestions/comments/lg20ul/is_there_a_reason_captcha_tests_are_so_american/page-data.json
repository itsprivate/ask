The thing is, it doesn’t so much check to see if I’m <em>human</em> as check to see if I’m <em>American.</em></p>\n\n<p>“Select all squares with crosswalks”</p>\n\n<p>“Select all squares with fire hydrants”</p>\n\n<p>“Select all squares with parking meters”</p>\n\n<p>These things do not exist in my country. I’ve heard of parking meters but I’ve never actually seen one and am not really sure what they look like. Fire hydrants show up in cartoons sometimes but I was under the impression they were red and round at the top - CAPTCHA has taught me they come in all different colours and shapes. Crosswalks I literally only learned about by doing CAPTCHA’s.</p>\n\n<p>You may be asking “what crazy underdeveloped third-world country are you from? Do you have to walk 10 miles to the nearest well to get water every day? Do you have to catch your own meals with spears and rocks?” Well, no. I’m just British.</p>\n\n<p><em>These things only exist in America.</em> Occasionally I’ll be asked to find a word I actually know, but even that is a trick. I’ll be asked to click all the buses, and find that I’m also expected to click on coaches, too. A coach is different to a bus, but I guess not in America. I’ll be asked to click all the traffic lights, of course I know what a traffic light is. Or do I? Because apparently in America “traffic light” means “yellow box.”</p>\n\n<p>It just seems bizarre. Of all the thousands of things that exist which have the <em>same</em> name and <em>look the same</em> in every country, why on earth do CAPCTHA tests seem to <em>exclusively</em> ask you to identify things that only apply to the United States?</p>\n\n<p>Is it to stop Chinese/Russian attacks on websites? Or is it just an infuriating coincidence?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/lg20ul/is_there_a_reason_captcha_tests_are_so_american/","title":"Is there a reason CAPTCHA tests are so American?","tags":["NoStupidQuestions","reddit"],"date":"February 09, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-09T16:51:39.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-09 16:51","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lg20ul","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/lg20ul/is_there_a_reason_captcha_tests_are_so_american/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/lg20ul/is_there_a_reason_captcha_tests_are_so_american/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"NoStupidQuestions","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions","author":"maxisaladfresh","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/maxisaladfresh","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"maxisaladfresh","score":107,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"CAPTCHA测试如此美国化是有原因的吗？","the_new_excerpt":"显然，作为一个互联网用户，我几乎每天都被要求 \"证明\"。\n我是人 \"与验证码测试。问题是，它并没有那么多的检查，以确定是否有\n我是人类，因为检查我是否是美国人。\n\n\"选择所有有人行横道的广场\"\n\n\"选择所有有消防栓的方块\"\n\n\"选择所有...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"CAPTCHA測試如此美國化是有原因的嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"顯然，作爲一個互聯網用戶，我幾乎每天都被要求 \"證明\"。\n我是人 \"與驗證碼測試。問題是，它並沒有那麼多的檢查，以確定是否有\n我是人類，因爲檢查我是否是美國人。\n\n\"選擇所有有人行橫道的廣場\"\n\n\"選擇所有有消防栓的方塊\"\n\n\"選擇所有...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-m1lcgw","excerpt":"Would a farmer have ever complained about the \"scurry of squirrels\" messing with\nhis crops?
