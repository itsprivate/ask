All along we thought he was a healthy/energetic older dog. About 3-4 months before this shocking news, he starts lightly digging in our yard. He has never been a digger. It took 2-3 weeks to complete his project. Which is now a perfectly oval hole, 3-4 inches deep. We would randomly find him in his home made hole, just hanging. We joked about him digging his own grave. Now, I feel like it all makes sense. He is hanging in there, some days worse than others. I’m grateful that he is not in pain. He will still go lay in his hole and I’m at peace with this. When he is ready, I will be there. \nDo you believe dogs know way before we are known of their diagnosis? </p>\n\n<p>My pup is suffering from a ruptured tumor on his spleen.
