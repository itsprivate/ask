I just don’t understand where it’s all gone.</p>\n\n<p>Also this was all also happening pre-covid, it’s not just due to lockdown &amp; as a frame of reference I’d say someone in the community made food to give out at least 2 times a month, with your neighbours thing would be shared like 3 weeks or so. You’d see family all the time and actually chat to them properly.</p>\n\n<p>I have a theory but may be wrong, increased costs of living with no real wage increase has caused us to work longer, thus causing worse moods + more tiredness resulting in just wanting wanting time to relax and to ourselves, but what do you guys think, am I being crazy?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/l5s8yz/anyone_else_feel_like_community_spirit_helping/","title":"Anyone else feel like community spirit, helping others, being kind etc is dying slowly, year on year?","tags":["NoStupidQuestions","reddit"],"date":"January 27, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-27T10:51:39.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-27 10:51","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l5s8yz","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/l5s8yz/anyone_else_feel_like_community_spirit_helping/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/l5s8yz/anyone_else_feel_like_community_spirit_helping/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"NoStupidQuestions","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions","author":"DefinitelyNotMagnus","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/DefinitelyNotMagnus","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"DefinitelyNotMagnus","score":118,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"还有人觉得社区精神、助人为乐、善良等正在逐年慢慢消亡吗？","the_new_excerpt":"老兄，我还记得你跟邻居和家人聊天的日子。\n往往，人们会与邻居分享食物，社区总是\n互相帮助，善待是一件事。即使在圣诞节期间（我不\n庆祝）但所有的人，从商店工人等都在...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"還有人覺得社區精神、助人爲樂、善良等正在逐年慢慢消亡嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"老兄，我還記得你跟鄰居和家人聊天的日子。\n往往，人們會與鄰居分享食物，社區總是\n互相幫助，善待是一件事。即使在聖誕節期間（我不\n慶祝）但所有的人，從商店工人等都在...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lrzibk","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/AskWomen/comments/lrzibk/hey_ladies_what_are_some_good_hair_care_tips_for/","title":"Hey ladies, what are some good hair care tips for those that are new to long hair?","date":"February 25, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"各位美女，对于刚接触长发的朋友来说，有什么好的护发技巧呢？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"各位美女，對於剛接觸長髮的朋友來說，有什麼好的護髮技巧呢？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lrwpaf","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/AskReddit/comments/lrwpaf/what_food_do_you_just_completely_despise_and_why/","title":"What food do you just completely despise and why?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"February 25, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"你完全鄙视什么食物，为什么？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"你完全鄙視什麼食物，爲什麼？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-l5s8yz","previousId":"RedditPost-lrzibk","nextId":"RedditPost-lrwpaf","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/l5s8yz/anyone_else_feel_like_community_spirit_helping/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
