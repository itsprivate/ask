It was called boxwimming, and involved two fighters, treading water/swimming in a deep swimming pool, fighting until the one of them was knocked unconscious.  In the dream, the losing fighter sank in the pool, and scuba medics who were on standby dived down and retrieved the fighter, who was fine once he reached the surface of the water.</p>\n\n<p>But if this were to happen in reality, if someone was knocked unconscious and went underwater, would they immediately inhale water into the lungs (and therefore drown)?  Or would the dive reflex kick in to prevent them from attempting to breathe whilst underwater?</p>\n\n<p>If anyone else has any thoughts about the practicalities of this hypothetical sport, I&#39;d love to hear them.
