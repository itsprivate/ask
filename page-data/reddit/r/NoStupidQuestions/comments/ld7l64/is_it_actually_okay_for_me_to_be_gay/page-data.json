I came from a very religious and homophobic family but thankfully I got out. I’m not religious anymore so when people tell me that it’s bad to be gay because it’s a sin, it doesn’t affect me much. Yet I still feel a lot of guilt and shame because of my desires. </p>\n\n<p>Is it really okay for me to be gay? My parents taught me that homosexuality is akin to pedophilia and incest. I’m not quite sure I see how, but I don’t want to be a bad person. </p>\n\n<p>It’s embarrassing for me to say this but I think my only desire in life is to live with another guy in our own house in nature away from everyone else and the only other ones there will be our seventeen cats. And maybe some chickens or something.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Thanks for everyone’s responses. I’m surprised by the amount of people who are supportive of me, I kind of expected it to be more split? Maybe that’s because most people on this subreddit are supportive so it’s biased but regardless— thank you, you guys are very kind. I guess I’m going to uhhhhhh just. be gay now. I don’t know how to “start” so I think for now I will just continue to stay single and daydream about being in a relationship with a guy all day every day. Maybe one day when I’m 80 I will hold a guys hand or something. Also FUCK everyone who commented who was unsupportive of my seventeen-cat-few-chickens situation, I think I will adopt eighteen instead now.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/ld7l64/is_it_actually_okay_for_me_to_be_gay/","title":"Is it actually okay for me to be gay?","tags":["NoStupidQuestions","reddit"],"date":"February 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-05T22:22:14.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-05 22:22","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ld7l64","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/ld7l64/is_it_actually_okay_for_me_to_be_gay/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/ld7l64/is_it_actually_okay_for_me_to_be_gay/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"NoStupidQuestions","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions","author":"solidraindropxx4","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/solidraindropxx4","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"solidraindropxx4","score":112,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"我真的可以做同性恋吗？","the_new_excerpt":"是否有任何实际的后果 对于同性恋，没有做的\n宗教？我来自一个非常虔诚的同性恋家庭，但庆幸的是我\n了出来。我已经不信教了，所以当人们告诉我，这是不好的，是。\n同性恋是因为它是一种罪过，对我影响不大。但我还是觉得...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我真的可以做同性戀嗎？","the_new_excerpt":"是否有任何實際的後果 對於同性戀，沒有做的\n宗教？我來自一個非常虔誠的同性戀家庭，但慶幸的是我\n了出來。我已經不信教了，所以當人們告訴我，這是不好的，是。\n同性戀是因爲它是一種罪過，對我影響不大。但我還是覺得...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lzga8o","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/AskReddit/comments/lzga8o/to_the_grubhub_doordash_or_any_other_food/","title":"To the Grubhub, Doordash, or any other food delivery employees, what is the strangest scenario you have had with an order?","date":"March 07, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"对Grubhub、Doordash或其他送餐员工来说，你遇到过的最奇怪的订单场景是什么？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"對Grubhub、Doordash或其他送餐員工來說，你遇到過的最奇怪的訂單場景是什麼？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lzga00","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/lzga00/why_is_megan_markle_getting_investigated_for/","title":"Why is Megan Markle Getting Investigated for Being a \"Bully\" to Staff Whilst Prince Andrew Is Barely Getting any Heat for Alleged Sexual Abuse of Minors?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 07, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"为什么梅根-马克尔会因为被员工 \"欺负 \"而被调查，而安德鲁王子却因为被指控性侵未成年人而几乎没有受到任何关注？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"爲什麼梅根-馬克爾會因爲被員工 \"欺負 \"而被調查，而安德魯王子卻因爲被指控性侵未成年人而幾乎沒有受到任何關注？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-ld7l64","previousId":"RedditPost-lzga8o","nextId":"RedditPost-lzga00","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/ld7l64/is_it_actually_okay_for_me_to_be_gay/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
