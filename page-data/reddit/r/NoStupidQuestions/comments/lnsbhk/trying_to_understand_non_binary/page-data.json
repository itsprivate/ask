I recently learned that apparently non-binary people are not necessarily &#39;in-between&#39; or &#39;intermediate&#39; but <a href=\"https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Non-binary\">may have multiple genders, either simultaneously, or in series</a> .</p>\n\n<p>I understand the concepts of male, female, transgender, heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, androgynous. If those are categories that people feel they are, that&#39;s up to them. We shouldn&#39;t be treating people differently on the basis of sex or sexuality anyway. What I don&#39;t get is the declaration of &#39;non-binary <em>AND</em>...&#39;, e.g. &#39;non-binary <em>AND</em> male&#39;; &#39;non-binary <em>AND</em> female&#39; ; &#39;non-binary <em>AND</em> female <em>AND</em> male&#39; etc. So you&#39;re saying that you are both &#39;x&#39; <em>AND</em> &#39;not-x&#39;? Or that it may change by the day? If I compare that to sexuality then an individual would simply be considered bisexual, perhaps serially monogamous, polyamourous, or promiscuous, but still simply &#39;bisexual&#39;. There are <a href=\"https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Category:Gender_Identities\">many gender identities one may find listed</a>. We might suppose that not all of these labels are sincere, but regardless I can&#39;t imagine that many people will have heard of many of these, still less be able to negotiate them. There&#39;s 219 categories on that page, so 47961 possible combinations of any 2 individuals. It does seem from the outside a little like children saying &#39;I&#39;m an angel! I&#39;m an eagle!&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>Can someone offer an explanation that makes sense in the context of fully adult life, not simply academia or student-hood where we all like to set the world to rights, but where we work 40 hour weeks, have a family etc, aren&#39;t trying to judge or be unkind but simply don&#39;t have several years to do a pHD in gender studies?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/lnsbhk/trying_to_understand_non_binary/","title":"Trying to understand 'Non binary'","tags":["NoStupidQuestions","reddit"],"date":"February 20, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-20T02:47:35.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-20 02:47","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lnsbhk","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/lnsbhk/trying_to_understand_non_binary/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/lnsbhk/trying_to_understand_non_binary/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"NoStupidQuestions","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions","author":"DevopsCandidate1337","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/DevopsCandidate1337","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"DevopsCandidate1337","score":103,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"试图理解 \"非二进制\"。","the_new_excerpt":"说实话，并不是想吐槽，只是有点莫名其妙。我最近才知道\n显然，非双性恋者不一定是 \"中间人 \"或 \"中间人\n但可以有多个性别，可以是同时的，也可以是串联的\n[https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Non-binary] 。\n\n我理解这些概念...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"試圖理解 \"非二進制\"。","the_new_excerpt":"說實話，並不是想吐槽，只是有點莫名其妙。我最近才知道\n顯然，非雙性戀者不一定是 \"中間人 \"或 \"中間人\n但可以有多個性別，可以是同時的，也可以是串聯的\n[https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Non-binary] 。\n\n我理解這些概念...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lns9wb","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/AskWomen/comments/lns9wb/women_what_is_something_that_women_experience_and/","title":"women, what is something that women experience and is seen as “normal” but is actually very wrong/shouldn’t be as accepted as it is?","date":"February 20, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"女性，有什么事情是女性所经历的，并被视为 \"正常 \"的，但实际上是非常错误的/不应该被接受的，因为它是什么？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"女性，有什麼事情是女性所經歷的，並被視爲 \"正常 \"的，但實際上是非常錯誤的/不應該被接受的，因爲它是什麼？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lnudzo","excerpt":"He passed away not from natural causes. his friends suddenly (and for no\napparent reason, we still cannot explain it) turned on him while he was alone.\nit was at night in his own car.
