I am really troubled and it’s my first time posting here so please any help or advice is welcomed. </p>\n\n<p>Last summer, I interned at a pharmaceutical company and I impressed, or at least I think I impressed my manager’s manager and he jokingly said that if I were to get all A’s he would hire me full time. I’ll be completely honest and say that if it wasn’t for that incentive I would not have made all A’s. I want to make him aware of the power he yields as a manager so he can get some gratification and sense of fulfillment out of his job, and also I want him to offer me a job without directly saying “HEYYY REMEMBER WHEN YOU SAID YOU’D GIVE ME A JOB IF I GOT ALL A’s” \nEnglish is not my first language so creative writing is not my strong suit.
