What I previously thought would manifest into an insatiable hole of sexual conquest has actually turned into the opposite.</p>\n\n<p>I have grown to realize that sex is such a small fraction of my happiness. I used to seek out arm candy and now I don&#39;t even bother. What I realized matters is in the heart... beauty is in the eye of the beholder. It&#39;s mostly on the inside of us, in our brains and hearts. Pussy has grown to possess no value to me whatsoever.</p>\n\n<p>I actually enjoy friendships with women in my life. I&#39;m thankful for the heartaches and the romances that have passed. Trying to objectify women for years has actually done the complete opposite- the more I met and slept with women, the more I realized that it doesn&#39;t matter.</p>\n\n<p>Sex is as desirable as eating, sleeping, or shitting. It&#39;s great for a few moments and then it ends. It&#39;s the life you live before and after that matters. There are many more satisfying things in life, filled with much more substance.</p>\n\n<p>So now I am 25 and see that I am a man I would never thought I&#39;d be. Still kinda horny, but with a different perspective.</p>\n\n<p>And I&#39;m wondering if anybody can relate.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: thank you for the awards. Lots of great replies and some judgemental ones too. Thank you all for coming together in a civil way to discuss something that I think a lot of men think about! God bless you all.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/AskMen/comments/l31dum/men_did_you_ever_reach_a_point_where_you_realized/","title":"Men, did you ever reach a point where you realized women don't actually make you happy?","tags":["AskMen","reddit"],"date":"January 23, 2021","dateISO":"2021-01-23T04:04:30.000Z","datetime":"2021-01-23 04:04","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"l31dum","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/l31dum/men_did_you_ever_reach_a_point_where_you_realized/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/l31dum/men_did_you_ever_reach_a_point_where_you_realized/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"AskMen","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen","author":"throwaway_68892188","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/throwaway_68892188","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"throwaway_68892188","score":10436,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"男人们，你们有没有到了一个地步，发现女人其实并不能让你们幸福？","the_new_excerpt":"我(25米)勾心斗角多年，有过几十个伴侣。我的\n以前认为会表现为贪得无厌的性征服的洞，现在已\n居然变成了反面教材。\n\n我已经逐渐意识到，性在我的幸福中是那么一小部分。I\n以前经常找胳膊糖，现在... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"男人們，你們有沒有到了一個地步，發現女人其實並不能讓你們幸福？","the_new_excerpt":"我(25米)勾心鬥角多年，有過幾十個伴侶。我的\n以前認爲會表現爲貪得無厭的性徵服的洞，現在已\n居然變成了反面教材。\n\n我已經逐漸意識到，性在我的幸福中是那麼一小部分。I\n以前經常找胳膊糖，現在... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lnz5jd","excerpt":"Same movies.
