My question: We have all heard the quoted 95% for e.g Pfizer and 70% effective for Oxford vaccines.  But it looked to me like the underlying study outputs and processes make those numbers completely incomparable. For example,  Pfizer only tested to confirm  (by PCR)  symptomatic patients,  whilst Oxford tested (at least in the UK cohort) weekly regardless of symptoms,  and as a result picked up a huge number of asymptomatic infections (almost half of the UK infections seen in the study) and included those in calculating its 70% figure.  Surely this means that on a comparable basis the Pfizer efficacy would be much lower? How can we compare them?</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/askscience/comments/ld31as/are_the_vaccine_efficacies_for_covid_vaccines/","title":"Are the vaccine efficacies for COVID vaccines able to be directly compared?","tags":["askscience","reddit"],"date":"February 05, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-05T13:20:27.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-05 13:20","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"ld31as","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ld31as/are_the_vaccine_efficacies_for_covid_vaccines/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ld31as/are_the_vaccine_efficacies_for_covid_vaccines/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"askscience","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience","author":"stickytreefrog","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/stickytreefrog","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"stickytreefrog","score":216,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"COVID疫苗的疗效是否能够直接比较？","the_new_excerpt":"首先，对不起，我错过了AMA（基于英国，所以时区问题）希望有人\n可以评论。我的问题是 我们都听说过辉瑞等公司的95%的报价。\n牛津疫苗70%有效。但在我看来，基础研究\n产出和过程使这些数字完全... ...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"COVID疫苗的療效是否能夠直接比較？","the_new_excerpt":"首先，對不起，我錯過了AMA（基於英國，所以時區問題）希望有人\n可以評論。我的問題是 我們都聽說過輝瑞等公司的95%的報價。\n牛津疫苗70%有效。但在我看來，基礎研究\n產出和過程使這些數字完全... ...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lz16ce","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/AskWomen/comments/lz16ce/if_youre_a_child_of_divorce_how_old_were_you_at/","title":"If you’re a child of divorce, how old were you at the time and how did it effect you?","date":"March 06, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"如果你是离婚后的孩子，你当时多大了，对你有什么影响？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"如果你是離婚後的孩子，你當時多大了，對你有什麼影響？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lz9vfj","excerpt":"I was drinking water and I started to think about if the water was draining into\nmy intestine as fast I was drinking it.","slug":"/reddit/r/askscience/comments/lz9vfj/how_fast_do_liquids_flow_from_the_stomach_into/","title":"How fast do liquids flow from the stomach into the small intestine?","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"March 06, 2021","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"液体从胃流入小肠的速度有多快？","the_new_excerpt":"我在喝水的时候，就开始想，如果水排到了\n我的肠道，因为快我喝了。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"液體從胃流入小腸的速度有多快？","the_new_excerpt":"我在喝水的時候，就開始想，如果水排到了\n我的腸道，因爲快我喝了。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"RedditPost-ld31as","previousId":"RedditPost-lz16ce","nextId":"RedditPost-lz9vfj","maxWidth":1024,"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/askscience/comments/ld31as/are_the_vaccine_efficacies_for_covid_vaccines/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1239077767","2506312863","2744905544","3493603132","3493603132","3513215887","386998304"]}
