However, I know that the ISS uses radiators. So the only thing that they can dissipate heat is through radiation, right? How efficient is that? For example, parts of the ISS use Ammonia to circulate heat. If I had X liters of Ammonia flowing evenly through a radiator system of area Y at Z degrees Celsius, how long would it take for the Ammonia to reach temperature T? Feel free to be as technical as you want, I come from a science and math background. In fact, I would even appreciate if someone could provide me with information or equations that I could use to calculate or estimate heat dissipation in space systems.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/askscience/comments/lmar2c/how_does_heat_dissipation_work_in_space_feel_free/","title":"How does heat dissipation work in space (feel free to be technical)?","tags":["askscience","reddit"],"date":"February 18, 2021","dateISO":"2021-02-18T07:35:43.000Z","datetime":"2021-02-18 07:35","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"fields":{"basePath":"/"},"thirdPartyId":"lmar2c","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/lmar2c/how_does_heat_dissipation_work_in_space_feel_free/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/lmar2c/how_does_heat_dissipation_work_in_space_feel_free/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"askscience","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience","author":"AnthroDragon","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/AnthroDragon","authorImage":null,"authorSlug":"AnthroDragon","score":101,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"空间的散热是如何进行的（感觉技术含量不高）？","the_new_excerpt":"我从来没有真正考虑过系统如何在太空中冷却自己，但... ...\n他们显然不能使用通过空气对流冷却。但是，我知道\n国际空间站使用的是散热器 所以他们唯一能散热的东西就是：\n通过辐射，对吗？这效率如何？例如，部分...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"空間的散熱是如何進行的（感覺技術含量不高）？","the_new_excerpt":"我從來沒有真正考慮過系統如何在太空中冷卻自己，但... ...\n他們顯然不能使用通過空氣對流冷卻。但是，我知道\n國際空間站使用的是散熱器 所以他們唯一能散熱的東西就是：\n通過輻射，對嗎？這效率如何？例如，部分...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-lm7abp","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/AskReddit/comments/lm7abp/which_tv_show_got_too_big_for_its_boots/","title":"Which TV show got too big for its boots?","date":"February 18, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","parent":{"__typename":"RedditJson","localize":[{"title":"哪部电视剧的靴子太大了？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"哪部電視劇的靴子太大了？","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-lm3ngp","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/AskReddit/comments/lm3ngp/you_have_an_incredible_nights_sleep_wake_up_and/","title":"You have an incredible night's sleep, wake up and the world is infested by zombies (9 out of 10 people).
